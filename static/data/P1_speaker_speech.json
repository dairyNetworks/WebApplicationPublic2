  "Exact Text": "First, it has not happened yet, so we cannot give definitive an­ swers on that but I anticipate that the current herd number will be able to produce between 15% and 17% more milk.  That is the estimate we have.  In other words, we can improve the yield per cow significantly.  Many NGOs, in particular, that have concerns around emissions and climate change miss this point.  The Irish dairy herd can produce much more milk and reduce the emis­ sions intensity of that milk production because the same cow of the same age will be producing more milk by better grazing management, better feed conversion efficiency and so on.  We are putting a great deal of research into that. There will undoubtedly also be an increase in the herd size between now and 2020.  We think this will be about an extra 300,000 animals.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I think those are the figures.  Obviously some more land will be needed for that, but there is a great deal of land in Ireland that is under-utilised in terms of stocking rate and with improved efficiency and better grazing management, many dairy farmers will be able to expand their output without requiring a lot more land.  Certainly there will be more competition for land among dairy farm­ ers.  That is true.  We are not predicting a significant reduction, for example, in beef output as regards suckler beef on the back of that.  What we will see now is a more focused look at how we use agricultural land more efficiently and more sustainably.  In all of our counties there are good examples of farms that could be more efficient and getting more young farmers into farm­ ing will help on that journey in terms of applying a more science-based approach to production. There will be an increased herd size.  We have already seen that in terms of the calving numbers this year, which are strong, and we have seen about a 12% increase in output of milk. We have probably had the best grass growth this year that we have ever had.  If one speaks to the co-ops, as we did yesterday, at the moment dairy farmers are getting very strong bonuses in terms of quality in milk components, which is helping with the difficulty as regards base price. There will be advance payments on GLAS and organics.  What we had planned was €20 million on GLAS and €10 million on organics.  We are now trying to plan €22 million on GLAS and €11.5 million on organics, which would be an 85% advance payment rather than a 75% advance payment.  We should, I hope, be able to factor that into our Estimates for this year.",

  "Exact Text": "The Department works closely with Animal Health Ireland in this area.  We did introduce an ex gratia payment in 2016 to fund the removal of animals.  No one is going to make much money on the scheme but it does help.  I appreciate the difficulty for any neighbouring herdowner whose herd becomes infected through no fault of his own.  However, we would not want to overstate the significance of the incidence either, which currently stands at 0.33%. The recent detection of clenbuterol proves the benefit of the investment the State makes in traceability and inspections, which are the cornerstone of the industry which we seek to promote, protect and see prosper.  That this incident was detected and dealt with effectively is good.  The Department was led on the matter primarily by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in terms of consumer safety.  I share the Deputy’s frustration that somebody would recklessly put the entire industry in the spotlight.  I am pleased, however, that the Department’s monitor­ ing, surveillance and traceability systems stood up to scrutiny.  I cannot say too much about the topic because it is the subject of ongoing investigation, but the Department will pursue the matter appropriately. Deputy Martin Kenny raised the issue of our level of compliance.  The subtext is that we are always the good people in Europe in complying with all of the regulations, but the reward is that we have the lowest milk prices in Europe.  The Deputy is conflating two issues.  As an island nation which produces a lot of food across many ranges, we have to export 90% of it. Accordingly, we have to have the highest standards.  In terms of the commitment of primary producers to origin green labelling and reducing our carbon footprint, it is critical to our market­ ing initiative because it gives us a cutting edge in the prices we can seek and as we seek to add value in the food chain.  We export 90% of our dairy produce.  Many of the markets across the European Union which are paying higher prices for milk are substantially domestic markets. They do not have the cost of getting their product to, say, the United States, the rest of Europe or emerging markets in China.  Our second largest market for dairy produce outside the United Kingdom is China.  We have the associated costs.  Even at a time when the Chinese market has slowed, we have increased our footprint there, particularly for infant formula, but we can only do it if we are the best in class.  I do not believe we should make any apology for being best in class in meeting the minimum standards required by the European Union.  We should also give ourselves an additional edge in the marketplace with our origin green, carbon footprint programmes.  If we did not have all of this, what would the price be?",

  "Exact Text": "In response to Deputy McConalogue’s question on the profiling of expenditure, it is important to remember that the figures presented to the committee are the six month figures for the outturns to the end of June.  There is no reason for alarm at this stage in respect of the profiled expenditure to the end of the year.  It is a difficult Department to manage in that many of the payments are demand led.  Many of them go out of the end of the year.  It is a management challenge to ensure we match expenditure with provision in the Department, but at this stage we are quite happy that our expenditure is on target. One thing that would have skewed the capital expenditure to the end of June is that the World Food Programme payment of €20 million, which is usually made in the first six months, was not made until the early weeks of July.  That would bring expenditure close to being exactly where we wanted it.  We are, broadly speaking, on target.  This is an ongoing issue in respect of managing the finances.  We have a good track record in the Department of spending every  22 Estimates for Public Services 2016: Vote 30 - Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine penny that is provided to us and that is a challenge we continue to track to ensure we deliver the best possible outcomes for the fishing and farming communities that we serve. On the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, our profiled expenditure on that up to the end of June was €2 million ahead of schedule.  We are quite satisfied with the level of pro­ vision.  Based on the broad statistics, we have in excess of 24,000 in the scheme already.  We will make many payments in December on that scheme.  I know many of the members were at the National Ploughing Championships.  If they were in the Teagasc, Bord Bia or Depart­ ment tents, they will have seen that one of the things we are constantly pushing on the BDGP is the requirement for recipient farmers to complete the carbon navigator task because that is a precondition to receiving the payment and it is part of the original raison d’être of the scheme. We are on target.  By 20 September 11,500 had completed the carbon navigation task, but of the 24,000 in the scheme quite a few have yet to do it.  We expect that we will be paying that out as provided for. The Deputy asked, and the IFA too has raised the issue with me and my colleagues, about additional payment for suckler cows.  Two issues arise.  One, it would require an amendment to the scheme which has been approved under the rural development programme and that is a cumbersome process, and two, it would also incur additional tasks for farmers.  The BDGP scheme as constructed is quite an innovative and progressive scheme.  I think Deputy Penrose would agree.  I watched his performance in committee recently.  Even sceptics of the scheme have come around to it and recognise the potential for it to achieve what the economic breeding index, EBI, has done on the dairy side.  There is no intention on my side or that of the Depart­ ment to seek to impose an additional obligation on farmers in respect of doing something for suckler cows.  For those in the scheme, that would also skew the payments and would cause difficulties in respect of our ambition to open the scheme to others.  There is provision of €300 million in the lifetime of the rural development programme for the scheme.  Long before I or my predecessor arrived there was a record of drawing down every penny on schemes.  We do not leave money behind in Europe and will not do so in respect of this scheme.  We would prefer to do that in a fashion that allows more in rather than paying more for more complicated tasks which it would take some time to have approved and about which it is a big question whether the Commission would desire it.  We are better off sticking with the construct of the scheme and getting more people into it. On the €11 million co-funding, prior to this meeting I had a meeting with my colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the matter of co-funding and several other matters relating to the budget.  That is a legitimate question.  We still hope that will be possible.  We have not thrown in the towel on that.  The precedent is there for co-funding. I might take with that the related question from Deputy Penrose on the dairy scheme gener­ ally.  There are in the region of 4,000 applications, so approximately one in four dairy farmers have applied for it.  If the payment is made as envisaged, at 14 cent per litre, it would approxi­ mate a benefit of €11 million for farmers.  That is if my recollection of figures is correct.",

  "Speaker": "Senator Michelle Mulherin",
  "Exact Text": "I wish to voice my concern about what I see as the general bashing and hammering of agriculture in public and media commentary and, at times, at EU level in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  When one looks at it in the round, and Mr. Callanan has described the layers of effort that are being made at every level in terms of farming practice and feed, one can see that every other aspect of farming is being examined and standards are required of farmers who are receiving payments so that their practices reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  I know farmers can vouch for this and when one hears what came out of the Citi­ zens’ Assembly, it is a cause for concern.  Sometimes it seems that we are having this conversa­ tion here and are privy to the data - the very good news about the steps being taken in farming to tackle climate change - but it does not seem to go much further than that.  Was Mr. Callanan invited to attend the Citizens’ Assembly as an expert?  Was anybody from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who is dealing with this issue hands on invited?  Was any other State body such as Teagasc invited?  Who presented?  That is one side of things. The other issue is that we need food and we will need more food as our population grows. We are doing it in a carbon-efficient manner and are probably doing it on a greater scale because we are more agriculture-dependent.  Agriculture brought us through the recession and is the backbone of our economy.  It seems there is a lack of common sense.  What input have the wit­ nesses had regarding the Citizens’ Assembly?  I know witnesses are called before the assembly to give evidence and explain what is happening. Regarding tackling climate change, I feel there is a philosophy that we are going to turn back the clock and that perhaps we should not take as many flights and we should all use bi­ cycles.  I would put in that same bracket the idea that on that basis alone, we will cut back our national herd whether it is the dairy or suckler cow herd.  Anybody speaking in the real world has to say that it must be about innovation, knowledge transfer and knowledge exchange.  It must be about finding new ways of doing things.  It is very disappointing to hear this said about agriculture when we see what is happening in transport across the board.  Where many people can take personal responsibility regarding carbon emissions coming from the use of fossil fuels such as oil in transport, they do not choose to do that but they constantly seek out agriculture as this big category that should be brought to task and in some way curtailed to help us achieve this.  I do not think it is realistic and there needs to be a very serious debate about this.  I appreci­ ate that when we go to the table in Europe and deal with other member states, we must discuss it.  We would do so because we have nothing to hide, but while one can modify a car, one cannot modify a cow.  Some of it is a bit ridiculous. When we are attending European summits such as the Paris summit or where we are dealing with other member states, are we seriously being asked to cut our national herd?  Is this really being flagged as a serious prospect for this country?  One of the witnesses mentioned that it is a key issue being flagged by the EU.  If farmers and the general population are to get on board, which is aside from what we are asking people to do in farming, we need to have a conversation that has more common sense when it comes to various industries and how people live their lives and their lifestyles.  I would welcome some real answers rather than us all saying how what is happening is terrible and these are the steps we are taking.  It must be grounded in reality.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank Ms Justice Laffoy and the Citizens’ Assembly.  It is fantastic that we have such a clear and strong position taken by the assembly on the need to tackle climate change.  This has become much more topical, particularly in the media, and it is an issue about which people are talking.  It should not be viewed as entirely negative because with the right investment in the right technologies, it can provide economic opportunities.  Fur­ thermore, we have not been living in a sustainable way and now we have the opportunity to develop new systems and new ways of living that are more desirable in the context of the future of the planet.  All of that is really good.  However, like previous speakers, I am concerned about the farming community in particular.  There was quite a negative reaction to the report from many farmers and farming organisations and to be honest, I do not blame them.  The Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which completed a report on climate change and what might be done about it, is present. In terms of the deliberations of the assembly, farmers feel that fair consideration was not given to their position.  They are at the coalface in the context of climate change.  They are deal­ ing with it right now.  We had an emergency meeting yesterday on the fodder shortage.  People have to eat.  We want to eat and to have our food produced in the most carbon efficient way possible.  We are leaders in dairy in that regard and we want to do better in beef.  Farmers, as primary producers, are on such small margins and the idea of another carbon tax being slapped on them is very daunting, particularly in the west where one is talking about very marginal farms.  It seems that all of that did not go into the mix.  Farmers are members of the public and are crucial players in tackling climate change.  In the course of our deliberations, we heard that staff in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine who deal with the climate change requirements, objectives and goals were not consulted by the assembly.  I know that experts were brought in but I feel that the assembly was not given a complete picture.  I know that there were time constraints and I acknowledge that Ms Justice Laffoy has said that there could have been much more discussion. I am also concerned about the recommendation on the prioritisation of public transport over roads by a ratio of two to one.  That sounds fine but no major roads were built in the west or the north-west during the Celtic tiger period.  There is a massive infrastructural deficit in terms of roads in that region, which is now crying out for investment.  We are hoping that under Proj­ ect Ireland 2040 this investment will be delivered.  I know this is only a recommendation and people are trying their best but this highlights to me the extent of the rural, urban divide.  It also highlights a lack of understanding of what is required for sustainable living in rural Ireland. The west is not just a game reserve.  This is also related to the habitats directive - which we are not dealing with here today - which is also impeding the development of infrastructure in rural Ireland right now.  I hope that we get a chance to look at this as a committee because it is another dimension to the debate that we need to examine. I would like to see practical measures introduced that take on board agriculture, business and other concerns and bring stakeholders along rather than putting them off by telling them that they should not eat meat and should not do this, that or the other.  We are selling food to 180 countries and are producing that food as carbon efficiently as we can.  In the context of the new Common Agricultural Policy, more will be asked of farmers in terms of water quality, biodiversity and climate change.  Farmers seem to be easy targets, which is a concern of mine.",

  "Exact Text": "I know the Minister referred to Teagasc and the definition of approaching carbon neutrality.  Did he answer what pathway he sees for agriculture towards carbon neutrality by 2050?  How will that work?  It is fair to say that agriculture has been singled out for particular criticism for carbon emissions, and we need only look at the Citizens’ Assembly.  We all know, however, that we are the most carbon efficient when it comes to dairy, fifth best when it comes to beef, and we have great ambitions to do better.  Does the Minister see it as a difficulty or obstacle for us that in the EU compliance regime we are given no credit or recognition for the fact that we produce food more carbon efficiently than other EU countries? Notwithstanding all of the efforts that farmers have made when it comes to the sector being as­ sessed, other than it being put into the general pot to consider what our carbon emissions are, they get no credit for it and their hands are tied.  Surely this is not fair.  People have to be fed. Being fed is not optional.  We know that world markets show that more people are getting the protein in their diet from dairy and beef.  The demand is there.  If we do not supply it, another country will fill that gap, I have no doubt.  I am not talking about another EU country but a country that does not have the same strict standards as we do. We are encouraging farmers towards renewables, microgeneration and perhaps anaerobic digestion and solar panels, but I am very concerned that while we speak about these things as options for farmers, we need clarification that if farmers are given State grant aid to put a solar panel on a roof or are assisted with anaerobic digestion, it will not give them a credit on their farms whereby they can state they are reducing their emissions, taking personal responsibility and going whatever way they can on the road towards carbon neutrality on their farm, but in­ stead it is all put into the general pot.  I am not saying it is not a good thing if more people use solar panels, but we need to have a more tailored approach to farming given the efforts farmers have made and the successes they have had.  This needs to be recognised and put out there. I have a question on the carbon tax.  Farmers were identified by the Citizens’ Assembly in particular for an additional carbon tax in certain circumstances, but I want to ask about the big­ ger picture.  This is a worldwide problem.  Are Middle Eastern and OPEC oil-producing coun­ tries being taxed?  What is the principle?  What are their commitments?  The problem is fossil fuels and that is what we are trying to rid our system of.  They are producing them.  How will they pull back on them?  Will they be carbon taxed in some way?  Have they signed up to it? As I see it, if a carbon tax is put on fuel in this country, which was not done in the recent budget and which I believe was a wise move, it will be the consumer who pays it.  We are here asking farmers potentially to take on an additional cost, as nothing has been decided, but what about the big oil-producing countries providing to the market and making it so cheap and at­ tractive?  I have my doubts.  We keep being told about the oil that is still there and there is the debate about peak oil, but we have to drill down into this.  There are ramifications for individu­ als in a sector that has a lot of positivity and has a lot to add to our economy.",

  "Speaker": "Deputy Bríd Smith",
  "Exact Text": "I thank the deputations all for the presentations.  I assume everyone here accepts the science of climate change.  I believe if the deputations were able to be honest – they probably cannot say what I can say – they would agree that the national mitigation plan is rather depressing.  It does nothing to get us to where we need to be. The projection given by the Environmental Protection Agency in the presentation is fright­ ening.  I assume that it is scientifically absolutely accurate.  Anyway, it is frightening to look at the graph and see how we came from 1990, when we were at a given level of CO2 emissions per tonne.  The level went up during the boom and then back down again during the recession. We are beginning to climb again.  The last figure we have is for 2016.  Where do we need to be by 2050?  The target is 5 megatonnes.  How the hell are we going to get there when it has been said here today that it is not possible to set out a plan to 2050 and that it is a working document? I can see why it is not possible. One thing that illustrated this to me above all in recent weeks was the excited announcement by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine of a new deal with China for thousands of cattle and thousands of tonnes worth of dairy product.  That was followed quickly by the discussion in the Dáil and the debate among farmers on the fodder crisis.  We had a fodder crisis because climate change meant that it had rained heavily not only this winter but the previ­ ous winter as well.  We had a fodder crisis because the big producers bought up all the fodder when the climate responded as it did.  Thus family farmers cannot manage to feed their cattle and cattle are dying.  Yet, these family farmers have admitted to us that they are coming under increasing pressure all the time from the Department and their own organisations to breed more cattle and dairy cows because the market is dictating the pace. I can see why the market is attractive.  Certainly, it is not attractive to family farmers in this situation but it is attractive to mega-producers.  We need a plan whereby Departments speak to one another and whereby the economy has some level of grip on what is happening with climate change. I come from the left and therefore I have more interest in a planned economy that does not allow the free market to reign supreme.  I believe that at some point the free marketeers are go­ ing to have to sit up and take notice.  Otherwise they are going to destroy the planet and bring us to the point where there is no return from climate change.  That is why I am keen to see a Minister and Department that scream at other Ministers and Departments to stop doing this and explain we need to talk to one another, join the dots and plan this out together.  I realise the deputations must be extraordinarily frustrated and angry that this is not happening because they are all scientists and they all know what is going on. I wish to put some specific questions to the Department.  Why does the national policy posi­ tion not mention industry, manufacturing, waste and other types of energy emissions?  Why are these left out altogether?  I am not going to make any assumptions about it.  Can the Department representatives expand on the point a little? I am keen for the discussion about transport to be teased out a little.  I hear other Deputies referring to the need for non-diesel buses.  To be honest, however, the real problem is the num­ ber of private cars on the road.  The level of emissions from private transport is far higher than emissions from public transport.  If we could reduce private use of cars on the road to a fraction of what it is at present, we would be doing ourselves a major favour in respect of our emissions. One need only be on the M50 early in the morning to see gridlock on a four-lane motorway in both directions and then understand that the private use of cars is far out of proportion.  The reason is bad planning.  When industry, homes and estates are built it is clear planners and de­ velopers do not take into account the need for transport hubs to be nearby.  Such considerations may be in the development plans of county councils - when I was a county councillor I recall working out the plans for transport hubs - but the plans are never implemented in a reasonable way that takes private cars off the road in large numbers.  Will the EPA representatives and oth­ ers comment on that point?  Perhaps they do not see it as the role of the agency to comment. I know it might be seen as a gesture but would the organisations represented here, includ­ ing the Department, support the Bill on climate emergency measures to leave fossil fuels in the ground?  The Bill will be before the committee in July.  Does the Department see that as a posi­ tive measure in contributing to reducing CO2 emissions and sending out a signal that we need to wake up, smell the coffee and take this seriously?  There is nothing in the plan to show us that we are plotting and managing what has gone off the radar in terms of our emissions.  The EPA graph says it all.  Everyone should look at it because it is startling.",

  "Exact Text": "On agriculture, the talk is always about decarbonising Ire­ land.  I know that for the purpose of debate we talk in generalities.  Other than at the Joint Com­ mittee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine where we prepared that report, the impression is often that farmers can be collateral damage regarding the efforts we make.  I feel that was the impression the Citizens’ Assembly gave to agriculture in its recommendation.  I do not accept this as somebody who comes from that region and sees the significance that farming has to rural areas.  We can talk about dairy, but if beef is taken out of the equation at one sweep, it would close down the west and north west. The witnesses alluded to forestry.  I do not consider it a community where people are look­ ing out at trees, and this is a problem.  I know there are competing interests.  As other colleagues here have done, I would also like to highlight the real issues of ordinary people on the ground. We have targets for Food Wise 2025.  We are selling food into 180 countries.  If these beef farmers, who seem to be a problem for so many people, are removed from the equation, it will not be just the farmers who are gone.  They supply to people finishing the beef and the whole food industry.  What the Climate Change Advisory Council is proposing is massive. I agree that we need to try to improve the situation, as do farmers and the farming organi­ sations.  At the end of the day, when we talk about decarbonisation of society, we still have to eat, so why not have Ireland become the carbon-efficient people?  If this idea is taken to the extreme, we would all become vegans.  Where is the choice in all this?  Where is the reality in all this?  It does not match with what I see.  I would be in favour of innovation, thinking outside the box and all the rest.  Much of the conversation seems to be at an academic level. In my area there have been objections to wind farms, transmission and everything else.  I have never seen the people, who are telling us that we need all of this, at a public meeting advo­ cating why we need this infrastructure etc.  The people on ground and their public representa­ tives are trying to advance the cause of their areas and also help people deal with the fallout of being asked to cater for infrastructure.  Everybody is an expert at the round table but when they go on the ground, they are not listening to the ordinary person and the ordinary communities who are being asked to facilitate infrastructure.  As the witness said, the margins for farmers are so small because they are so regulated in everything they do.  As Senator Paul Daly said, they are taking great steps towards reducing carbon emissions.  While farmers and the farming or­ ganisations must step up to the plate, if we want to bring them with us we need to acknowledge what they are doing.",

  "Exact Text": "In general, I do not mind who answers.  What has been said here shows that people have interesting and useful perspectives.  We are trying to drill down to find actions for how to proceed.  I do not agree with my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  We have to recognise there is an urban-rural divide because a lot of what we talk about needing to be done will affect rural areas.  More will be required of people in rural Ireland, in respect of how they live, land use and so on, than will be required of people in the cities.  For example, there will be an issue if the peat-fired power stations are closed down.  I know people acknowl­ edge there is an issue but this involves an urban-rural divide.  There will be an issue with the fallout from what people are being asked to do in terms of the local economy and so on.  It is a similar case with regard to farmers.  It is not much consolation to hear that our farmers are the most carbon efficient in the dairy sector and the fifth most efficient in the beef sector.  It does not really matter because of the actions of the Germans.  I do not think they are a good example in terms of their credentials in respect of the environmental aspects of cars, especially those of one particular brand. We need to say that food is different.  We need to be fed.  If it is desired to set a standard or a bar and we set it, other countries involved in farming need to recognise that.  I get that farmers in Belgium will not roll over and let Ireland do as we like; we have a market going on here.  I am for setting the standard if we get recognition that this is the way to farm and that this the most carbon efficient way to farm.  If we are setting the standard, there should be some recognition for it.  I do not find it very satisfying to hear in the general discussion that there are all these dif­ ferent sectors and that farming will just have to step up to the plate the same as everyone else. One cannot modify a cow in the way one can modify a car.  There are certain issues and certain realities involved.  We have to eat.  Wind farms are not being built and transmission lines are not being put up in the middle of cities.  One does not hear of all these protests.  Sometimes it is literally like representing a whole different country in respect of some of the issues that are really pertinent to rural Ireland. If the peat-burning power station is removed, one then runs into the issue of what other in­ vestment can be made there to support work, jobs and investment and into this issue of critical mass.  It is said that an area does not have a critical mass.  The case for extending the Luas in the city is always better than our case.  It then becomes a vicious circle.  We lose population and we lose young people because of the way the economy is run.  We might achieve some nice desires, such as building a community centre or a football pitch, but more than that is required. We need a tipping point to make rural Ireland sustainable environmentally but also sustainable from an economic point of view. Mr. Stanley-Smith pointed out the problem with draining high-carbon lands but not being able to drain goes back to farmers again.  I assume it also applies to Coillte if it is doing drain­ age works for forestry, which we are encouraging though I know there is a dispute over what the nature of the trees should be.  To go back again, we have the habitats and birds directives. Farmers are crippled.  Some 55% of lands in my county are designated.  Farmers are severely restricted.  I met a farmer who was asking to fence off a drain near his land.  He was told by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to go downstream and to put in a sump on a stream to protect freshwater pearl mussels on adjoining lands that were not even his. It is not just that.  The road from Galway to Clifden is running into difficulties on account of running partly through a special area of conservation, SAC.  We have had serious difficulties in upgrading one of our national primary roads in Mayo, the N26, because of freshwater pearl  52 Third Report of the Citizens’ Assembly: Environmental Pillar mussels and whooper swans.  I am talking about upgrading and realigning roads that are already there.  A whole area in which there is already settlement is an SAC.  It is an SAC even though there is already significant settlements of human beings in the area.  There is no recognition of this.  It is the same in Glenisland.  We got money to build a bridge but it cannot be built because it is a designated area for freshwater pearl mussels.  As I said at a meeting of the Joint Com­ mittee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, wild mushrooms are rarer than freshwater pearl mussels in Mayo.  I am not being facetious but we have to get the balance right.  Whatever we do, we must recognise the additional burden on people in rural Ireland in terms of infrastructure and restricting their lifestyles.  Farmers were encouraged to invest in the dairy and other sectors to achieve our food production targets under Food Wise 2025.  Are the delegates now making the point that we should scale back on the level of food production and decrease the size of the national herd because of the level of carbon emissions? Moneypoint is a coal-fired power station which is proposed to be converted.  I understand there is a similar coal-burning power plant in Wales which has been partially modified for the use of biomass.  The point has been made that there is no sustainable biomass supply in Ireland to decommission the coal-fired power station completely.  What can we learn from the experi­ ence of the Welsh power plant?",

  "ID": 267,
  "Year": 2018,
  "Sliding_year": "2018-2020",
  "Speaker": "Senator Ian Marshall",
  "Exact Text": "I thank Mr. Donnellan for his presentation which included a lot of useful information.  As we all know, agriculture and transport are very often portrayed as the villains, but it is important to state at the outset of the discussion that agriculture and farming reacted to demand.  Food demand stimulated growth in agriculture, to which farmers were only reacting. Senator Daly has alluded to the period in which there was no growth and no opportunity for it in dairy production.  Therefore, we have a set of figures and information that probably do not reflect the true position on the expansion of dairy production, which was explosive.  The sector has been portrayed in a poor light, which is unfair. Mr. Donnellan has mentioned what could really make a difference by way of mitigation in agriculture.  On estimated breeding value, EBV, we all know that better performing and more efficient animals help our case. An interesting concept associated with forestry has been raised a number of times at this committee.  I made the point at an earlier meeting today that when forestry was mentioned to farmers, it was a little like saying to the those in attendance that if they made the windows of their houses smaller, they would be more efficient and conserve more heat.  That is radical and represents a long-term, significant change.  In a similar vein, planting a forest represents as radi­ cal a shift to farmers and I understand why they have difficulties with it. Let me refer to something we sometimes miss in this debate.  Reference has been made to our ability to grow grass.  This is arguably the second best grass growing region in the world. Actively growing productive grass would sequester a lot of carbon.  I am led to believe 15 cm of topsoil sequesters as much carbon as a tropical rainforest.  In other parts of the world forest plantation can present a challenge owing to arid conditions.  This is the result of carbon loading and the risk of fire.  As much as planting forestry is an option, has there been enough emphasis placed on actively managing productive farmland and pasture?  That, in itself, would sequester a lot of carbon.  Mr. Donnellan has mentioned the impact of fertiliser and referred to making the shift from calcium ammonium nitrate to urea.  I am led to believe this is subject to the pH value being right.  It is not a simple switch, as sometimes portrayed.  If we are to make a shift to using urea, especially urea with inhibitors, we have to manage pH values.  Therefore, more lime would have to be spread on land.  Is there a risk in some of these discussions that we will oversimplify solutions?  Is the matter not more complex than very often portrayed? Deputy Brian Stanley took the Chair. ",

  "Exact Text": "I thank everyone for their contributions.  I wish to start by fully agreeing with the IFA that this is not just an Irish issue.  Greenhouse gases do not go up over a country and keep within its border; they go into the atmosphere.  It is a global issue, and I fully acknowledge that the IFA acknowledges this.  It was therefore really unhelpful for the Minister to say the other day that there is no contradiction between growing a herd and reducing emis­ sions.  Clearly, this is not in line with the reports that continually come before us, whether from Europe or the EPA or our own reports.  They show us that agricultural emissions are increasing year on year and have increased for four out of the past five years, and the main contributor to that is the growing of the herd.  I understand that the IFA is here to defend its members and their position but I also appreciate that people will find it difficult to be green when they are in the red.  This is why the notion of a carbon tax that should be imposed on everyone, regardless of their circumstances, is not on, as proven by the people of France - the farmers and the workers and the people from villages, towns and cities.  One does not impose a carbon tax on ordinary people who cannot afford it without providing an alternative.  If people in this country had a great alternative in terms of public transport but refused to use it because they wanted to go in and out in their Ferraris, I would say, “Tax them to hell.”  They do not have an alternative, be­ cause we do not have good public transport.  We have people living in satellite towns outside of the big cities who must drive in and out to work because they have no choice.  If we were given the alternative, the carbon tax would be absolutely sound, but in this situation it is not.  Neither is it sound for farmers, except, of course, in the case of big ranchers who make vast profits.  I am an urban dweller and not familiar with who is who in rural Ireland in terms of agricultural production but I do know that there are certain types of farmer who are vastly wealthy, grow huge numbers of cattle and dairy herd and make a lot of their profits from exporting. I wish to make a small point about the discussion about Food Wise and food production be­ cause this is also not just an Irish issue but a global issue.  I was quite shocked to see Bord Bia recently spend an awful lot of its time, money and energy on promoting Irish beef and dairy in countries whose populations have never eaten beef or dairy, such as China and the Middle East, countries where there is no tradition of eating these types of food and no health barometer in this regard.  Bord Bia is really pushing farmers to grow more cattle here for more exports.  This just does not make sense because it is leading to increased greenhouse gas emissions. I have a couple of questions.  On the question of global food production, this conversation is really useful and interesting.  I think it was the witness from ICOS, Mr. Spellman, who pro­ posed that we should have a national forum on the future of farming.  That is a brilliant idea.  I am not as critical of the Citizen’s Assembly as some of the witnesses are but I do not think the recommendations on agriculture are sufficient.  I would like to know what they think of the idea of a national forum on farming and food production and how it might contribute to this overall plan to help us reduce our national CO2 emissions. Lastly, I noticed in the submission from the hill farmers that there is a lot of talk of a national forestry policy.  Do they believe that the policy as structured and implemented through and by Coillte is sufficient?  If not, what must change to make our forestry policy more realistic, more long-term and more sustainable?",

  "Exact Text": "We are conscious in the Department of the obligation in the sector to address the emissions profile in agriculture.  Under the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, we have funding available.  Deputy Pringle mentioned ammonia.  That is one area where we are significantly challenged because our ammonia emissions are virtually at the ceil­ ing.  We are grant-aiding low emissions slurry spreading as a technology in contrast to splash- plate spreading of slurry.  The former reduces ammonia emissions by in the region of 30%. That is one area where there is a significant gain. There is a host of other initiatives and the agrifood industry generally needs to take these on board.  These include investment in the beef data genomics programme.  We are enhancing that through the additional allocation in the 2019 budget for the beef environmental efficiency scheme to reduce the carbon footprint of the beef sector.  There are those who will say that, rela­ tively speaking, our emissions profile in the beef sector competitive, but we need to do more. Along with New Zealand, we are considered to be one of the most carbon efficient produc­ ers of dairy per unit of output.  However, we need to reduce emissions intensity in the dairy sec­ tor as well.  Measures such as the beef data genomics programme and the beef environmental efficiency scheme will enable us to accelerate the journey to a more carbon efficient beef sector by having a small suckler cow, a bigger weanling, a more fertile suckler cow and a cow that is easy-calving.  All these collectively contribute to a lower carbon footprint on the slaughtered animal.  That is important, not only because of the climate change responsibility but also in­ creasingly important for the market, which is asking questions about the environmental sustain­ ability of the industry. We have measures such as milk recording on the dairy side.  There has been increased out­ put in the dairy sector since quotas were abolished.  I have seen figures suggesting that 70% of the increased output has come from increased cattle numbers and 30% from increased use of genetics.  We need to turn the tables substantially and get more from improved genetics in the dairy herd.  Up to a point, it is understandable that there may have been a headlong rush to avail of the opportunities post quota.  However, we now need to concentrate on catching up with efficiencies.  We need to ensure data are available from milk recording.  Currently, milk record­ ing is used in only 40% of dairy herds.  Increasing the number of herds where milk recording is used and using the data from milk recording to improve the genetic merit of the dairy herd further would have been considered to have been a leader in terms of the economic breeding index.  We need to do more in that area.  That will allow us to get more production from fewer cow numbers.  That improves the carbon efficiency of the industry. Grassland management is a particularly important area, as is improving soil fertility.  It is a staggering figure, but in the beef sector fewer than 1% of beef farmers are involved in grassland management.  Grassland management involves measuring grass growth using pasture base or other technologies that are available to ensure production is from a sustainable food source. We can grow grass better than anyone else.  Promoting use of grass measurement is important. Teagasc runs the Grass10 programme.  Yesterday, we had the announcement of the grassland farms of the year across the dairy, sheep and beef sectors.  We need to mainstream grassland management.  Again, there is higher participation on the dairy side but we need to ensure that these practices are brought into the mainstream across all sectors. We need to improve soil fertility to its optimum level and reduce in some instances the amount of chemical fertiliser that we need to apply.  When applying fertiliser we should use the most environmentally friendly options, for example, protected urea as opposed to using calcium ammonium nitrate as a nitrogen source.  That significantly improves the effect of the release of nitrous oxide, which is another one of the greenhouse gases.  Soil fertility is important. Another side of this is greenhouse gas production.  If we are producing food, we will have greenhouse gas production.  We need to look at how we can sequester the maximum amount of carbon possible.  We spend in excess of €100 million on the Department’s afforestation and forestry road programme.  It is important that farmers take up the opportunity this presents. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, recently concluded a review of the forestry programme and has tweaked it significantly, with new options such as low-density agri-forestry to try to address the mix of deciduous and hardwood trees.  We are increasing the payments marginally to improve take-up to sequester carbon production. There is no one initiative that will address this problem on its own.  It will involve a combi­ nation of a series of initiatives, some of which I have mentioned.",

Because of the increased op­ portunities in the post-dairy quota era, emissions that were either flatlining or on a downward trajectory have begun to rise again.  We have to factor in the fact that while they are rising, we are still the most carbon efficient.  There is demand.  Is it better for people who want dairy products to buy them from producers who are efficient and committed to being more so, or from producers who have a much higher carbon footprint?  We have an advantage in this regard.  We should build on that, but we must do so in the most climate-friendly way.",

  "Exact Text": "In the context of agriculture and emissions, Food Wise 2025 cannot be ignored.  Under that plan, we will ramp up food production in beef, dairy and other sectors.  As technology advances, we like to think that there will be technological solutions to problems arising.  The witnesses have outlined three important areas, namely, emissions reduc­ tion, carbon sequestration and the use of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels.  We can also add to that the need to find new markets for the €19 billion and the 23,000 jobs that will be lost. In reality, we cannot do to cattle what we can do to cars and we will run out of road when it comes to agriculture and carbon neutrality.  There are certain home truths about agriculture and food production in the context of emissions that cannot be denied.  This needs priority, not just in Government policy but also in people’s thinking because we are talking about food, which is not optional.  We do not have a choice about eating, although we can choose what we eat. The report produced by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine recog­ nised the importance of this issue.  One of its recommendations is that an impact assessment be conducted on the climate change and sustainability targets set out in Food Wise 2025 to deter­ mine how they match up with our carbon emissions targets.  As it stands, there are serious issues around emissions.  We are trying to get down to the nuts and bolts here.  A lot of what we are discussing today has been discussed previously.  Teagasc has contributed to these discussions and has highlighted the strides that have been made in terms of carbon efficiency.  Nonetheless, under Food Wise 2025, we are talking about increasing the size of the national herd, which has consequences.  What assessment has been done in that regard?",

  "Exact Text": "Mr. Gleeson has just moved into the area of my next ques­ tion.  What steps has the Department taken to ensure farmers have been given credit for the carbon efficiencies they have achieved?  I do not want to have a domestic conversation only but rather internationally, whether it is the Paris Agreement or any other climate action agreement. Mr. Gleeson said we are the best at dairy production and quite high in the ranks of beef produc­ tion, although it is acknowledged there is more to be done.  We want to be world leaders in this area and the world must be fed.  As I understand it, more and more of the world is choosing to get its protein, which is required in humans’ diets, from beef and dairy.  If we do not produce it, it will be somebody less carbon efficient. We need protein in our diets but in this country we do not have a great track record of growing beans and other protein-rich food crops, for which the most successful areas are in the warmer climates and the tropics.  I do not hear people who promote lifestyles without meat argue that many protein-rich foods, such as beans and so on, are imported from areas with a significant carbon footprint and take food out of countries where people do not have much in the first place. It is grand for us to have a conversation, but how is the message that we are a special case put out?  We are the top of the class in dairy and we will get top of the class in beef also, but how will that be recognised?  How will the farmer get credit?",

  "Exact Text": "I am conscious that we are all under time constraints, myself included.  Mr. Gleeson described credits received under the Paris Agreement, but we did not get credit for all the work done to bring dairy to where it is today.  It is regrettable because we made changes which other countries have not.  We are being responsible in how we produce it and we are up for more in the other sectors of our agriculture industry.  The situation, therefore, is not right. On the bio-economy, members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine visited the BEACON bioeconomy research centre at University College Dublin, where many technological advances are researched.  In particular, the committee was informed of a joint venture in Tipperary between Teagasc and Dairygold to make plastic as a by-product of dairy, which would replace fossil fuels and would be biodegradable in plastics and adhesives. My understanding is that Enterprise Ireland is investing there.  How is the Department investing in finding these technologies to reduce carbon emissions, or is it batting it over to some other Department?  What is the Department doing to help farmers? On renewable energy, what is the take-up of the renewable heat incentive scheme?  How has it affected farming and emissions reduction?",

  "Exact Text": "We are all aware of the importance of agriculture on the island of Ireland.  A target of a 30% decrease by 2030 is ambitious.  It is a large sector, with relatively low mitigation potential.  The points made about the three strands of work are valid.  Abatement, sequestration and displacement and substitution are important.  I was disappointed that a fourth strand - efficiency - was not included.  It is something we have overlooked in the industry.  If we make a comparison with the position after the Second World War, the output in terms of litre of milk per kilogramme of beef is much more efficient now, but we are not given credit for it. The point was made that agriculture would present some of the solutions, for which it should be credited. I will pick up on the comments made on small family farms and the public good element which is often overlooked.  Because we cannot put a number on it, it is difficult to quantify its value in the real economy.  What work has been done to establish the reality that there must be a place for large, efficient, modern farms in conjunction with and alongside small family farms? There is a notion among the wider public that big is always bad, but that is not the case.  Very often big farms can offer opportunities when it comes to welfare, the environment, efficiencies and our carbon footprint.  The reality, albeit it is not popular to say it, is that on the island of Ireland a big dairy unit has a smaller carbon footprint per litre of milk than a small family farm. However, it is not a comfortable discussion to have.  It is the reality, but we do not want to see Ireland covered by large industrial farm units.  As it is such an emotive subject, often charged by opinions of groups not directly involved in agriculture or food production, what work is being done to make sure everything we do is based on evidence-based policy and that we are not making policy decisions based on public opinion and what is in vogue?  We have paid the price for doing so in the past in the food industry.  For example, 20 years ago we were all told that saturated fats were killing us.  As a reaction, we removed saturated fats from our diets and replaced them with sugar.  Twenty years on we find that it is killing us.  We need to consider evidence-based policy underpinned by science.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome Professor Boyle.  He described some collabora­ tions with the education sector through institutes of technology and University College Dublin. Is there a defined role for Teagasc in the development of technological universities?  To what extent has Teagasc been consulted?  Would its participation be more on an ad hoc basis, de­ pending on the particular alliance of colleges involved?  With regard to the various education programmes and courses Teagasc rolls out for young farmers, including the green certificate, does Professor Boyle feel there is more it could do on issues pertaining to climate change?  As has been mentioned, we visited the BEACON bioeconomy research centre at UCD, which is encouraging and exciting.  There is so much potential and, clearly, technology will keep com­ ing at us. Another issue that regularly pops up here is that of the weak position of the farmer in the food supply chain.  There has been a European-wide consultation on this and measures will be taken particularly vis-à-vis multiple retailers but no solution has been implemented yet.  How do we help our farmers add value to their products?  We have seen the case of the mushroom farmers with whom UCD is working and the development of plastic as a byproduct from dairy. How will farmers benefit from this so they are not always crying?  This is not a derogatory term because it is true.  At present, we know the situation with regard to beef.  How can there be change for farmers regarding the prices they receive as primary producers and in the context of the bioeconomy?  Do they have to form co-operatives?  What are the means?  Has this been looked at? Professor Boyle mentioned climate change and our 2025 targets.  As Deputy Cahill outlined, there is more we can do with solar panels and anaerobic digestion but no matter what is done, it is not ring-fenced.  A farmer with a tractor working off a battery is not assessed on the basis of his farm.  The benefit of that carbon reduction may go to transport.  Are we in a situation whereby as we increase the national herd and increase our food output we are bound in terms of the obligations?  We all speak about how carbon efficient we are, particularly in dairy, and no­ body says we do not need to do more.  Whatever we do, if we are ramping up production there will be an increase, and if that is beyond what is envisaged for us in the 2020 and 2030 targets, do we need to renegotiate them?  We should be upfront about it and be proud of achievements in farming, considering how production has increased since the 1990s and carbon emissions have reduced.  Efforts have been made.  We need to have a conversation about it.  People have become more aware of climate change and want to be active and do something but instead of thinking they should do it themselves, they are looking at farmers and agriculture because they are the source of a significant volume of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions but they do not look at the fact that we need to eat.  The positives of farming are not being acknowledged. Realistically, where do we go with all of this?",

  "Exact Text": "It occurs to me straight away to invite the committee to visit Teagasc’s offices at some point in the future.  Reference was made to the food innovation hub at Moorepark, for which we have secured planning permission.  It will probably be constructed in 18 months or so, but it is part of a process of adding value in the mainstream activities, particu­ larly in the dairy sector.  We also recently won an Enterprise Ireland regional innovation fund grant, along with Dairygold and Cork County Council, to build an agri-tech hub at our Kilworth farm in order that we might study the whole area of precision agriculture.  There is a great deal of activity going on at Moorepark. On climate change, I would love to have the committee visit Johnstown Castle.  I was somewhat disappointed that a Deputy who represents the constituency in which I live stated that Teagasc has not really made a mark in the context of tackling climate change.  I strongly disagree with that assertion.  We have not been jumping up and down on the rooftops about it but, as far as I am concerned, the only coherent set of policy proposals produced on agricultural transition, as it is known, towards a neutral carbon future, was brought forward by Teagasc. We produced a very comprehensive document last June, A Marginal Abatement Cost Curve for Irish Agriculture, in which we outlined no less that 27 specific, science-based measures which, if adopted, would enable us to substantially achieve our 2030 targets.  The Deputies are correct to say that we will not achieve our 2020 targets in any sector.  Agriculture is going to be particu­ larly challenging as we move forward.  I agree with Senator Mulherin; I have said publicly that it is a perfectly legitimate aspiration for the agricultural sector to grow and for individual farm­ ers to grow their businesses.  Ireland has also signed up to internationally binding obligations. Teagasc identified different scenarios in the document to which I refer.  We have examined six different scenarios in respect of livestock numbers.  I will be happy to make the document in question available to the committee.  In fact, it is going to be discussed tomorrow at a meeting of one of the other joint committees. Emissions in Irish agriculture follow livestock numbers; there is almost a direct correlation. We have identified potential savings up to 2030 of 9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, which is significant in the context of a benchmark baseline of 20 megatonnes.  As far as I am concerned, we have been leading the way.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine endorsed our proposed measures and the new Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, Deputy Bruton, recently did the same.  We have solved the problem on a spread­ sheet and we are the only ones to have laid it out, which we can do because of our in-house expertise.  However, in spite of the weather over the past year, there is poor awareness among farmers of climate change in general and, specifically, the issue of ammonia, which I have been raising for some time. The challenge in respect of ammonia is significant and will be difficult to address.  Action needs to be taken on awareness and farm adoption.  Teagasc research indicates that farmers who switch from using calcium ammonium nitrate as a source of nitrogen to using stabilised urea would achieve the same yield in gas production, but greenhouse gases and ammonia would be reduced.  However, it is difficult to persuade farmers to make that change.  There is currently no significant difference in the cost of the two fertilisers.  Over several years we have shown that the application of slurry using trailing shoe technology leads to a significant reduction in emissions. The measures are available; adoption is the issue.  Although is not within our remit, it is im­ portant that policy support action in this area.  We have suggested that the next CAP be used to ensure that measures are consistent.  If the committee were to visit Johnstown Castle, members would be given a full run-down on the research.  We are expending significant resources in this area.  We must expend more in future because the measures we have identified are based on current knowledge.  The field of additives is rapidly changing.  In the past three weeks, we met representatives of three companies, which each developed a feed additive product.  Of course, the companies are optimistic about their products which must be analysed and so on.  It is a rapidly changing field in which we are investing significant resources.  The challenges will be in respect of adoption and policy to back up those measures. Reference was made to forestry.  I previously described forestry as a get-out-of-jail clause for the agricultural sector because we estimate that 3 megatonnes or one third of the savings we have identified may come from forestry.  Thankfully, enough trees were grown over the past 30 or 40 years to get us to 2030, but if the rate of plantation is not increased, there will be a serious difficulty in 2030.  We estimate that new plantations will decline to 4,500 ha this year.  The tar­ get is approximately 8,000 ha or 8,500 ha.  The rate of plantation has fallen consistently over the past two years.  There is a significant problem in that regard.  As members will be aware, there is significant opposition to forestry in certain parts of the country.  We must convince farmers, particularly dairy farmers, that they should have an interest in trees.  There is a big opportunity to have native woodland plantations on every dairy farm in the country.  I was surprised by the significant percentage of forest area on dairy farms, but there is more potential in that regard. It would be a fantastic gesture on behalf of the dairy sector to demonstrate its willingness to address the issue of climate change. On renewables, we have identified the potential of energy crops and so forth.  It is limited enough in the sense that there can be a displacement of fossil fuels.  I have been a strong advo­ cate of anaerobic digestion but the policy environment must be right.  We have built a demon­ stration plant in Grange, which is about to be commissioned, to illustrate to farmers how one can use the grass-based biomass to produce high-quality gas.  We have also been discussing with a number of entities how that might be developed further.  There is a great deal happening, but the policy follow through is an issue. Senator Paul Daly referred to farm safety.  Some colleagues who are here and members of this committee were at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts when the Chairman raised the issue of farm safety.  I am sure all of us have experienced a tragedy on a farm so we are all very aware of it.  Teagasc works very closely with the Health and Safety Authority. Our remit is to deliver advice and the authority has a different remit from ours but we have a collaboration agreement with it.  We do quite an amount of research because this is a very chal­ lenging area.  Most farmers have an awareness of the issues and hazards but  despite that, they still engage in practices that are clearly not safe.  We have carried out a great deal of research on the behaviour that motivates this type of attitude to health and safety and we have acquired many insights that can advise our advisory activity.  However, the Senator is 100% right.  If one were to use the metric of farm fatalities and, more generally, farm injury one would not be pointing to a positive trend. We constantly try to work on this.  For example, we are appointing an additional special­ ist in farm health and safety.  The specialist works closely with our 260 advisers.  That is how we do it.  We deliver the messages.  At almost every farm discussion group, there is a health and safety topic, but I would be the first to say that it is clearly not working.  Sermonising and preaching are not enough.  That is the reality.  I am happy to say that there has been a wel­ come improvement in the number of child fatalities.  The farmyard business and the household have to be separate in my opinion.  It is a dangerous place for young people, yet we see many transgressions.  We are appointing a new specialist and we are trying to adapt the insights from research.  A number of entities, including the Department, could, in my opinion, work more closely, particularly in the context of promotional campaigns.  We should all be involved in this together.  We are involved in promoting the code of practice and we have training programmes. Despite the massive effort the challenge has been elusive so far.  I wish I could suggest today what will make a difference.  At the same time we have long been of the view that regulation or enforcement does not work.  It is hard to put in place the level of inspectorate that is required.  I strongly believe it does not work but at the same time we must review what is happening. Deputy Penrose raised a number of important issues that I wish to address.  With regard to the food innovation hub, we have planning permission and we hope it will be completed in 18 months or so.  It will be a very important development.  There are already approximately 14 companies in Moorepark.  They are from all over the country and some are from overseas but are doing business in Ireland.  They have stated that they want a facility on site where they can have complete confidentiality, while at the same time being in a position to use the shared re­ sources available.  That is the strategy behind this.  It is all about providing added value.  I am not talking about a more exotic final consumer products lists, but there is a lot of valued added in food ingredients, particularly in infant formula.  We call it the smart ingredients approach. It is probably not all that visible, but it is where the innovation lies for the producers of these products. I want to address the issue of Greenfield farm.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I apologise for missing the first presentation by the EPA but I managed to watch the other presentations on screen. Climate change is a recurrent issue for this committee.  A number of us travelled to Brussels before Christmas.  The clear message that we got from MEPs, Commissioner Hogan and every­ where we went was that the new CAP scheme would place greater environmental requirements on farmers in terms of water quality, biodiversity and climate change.  Any responsible person would have to say that to grow an industry, with all that we now know and the witnesses are keenly aware of the fallout, things must be done in a sustainable fashion.  One will go nowhere if one does not do so and one is just pillaging the earth. We must to our best to rescue the situation and put ourselves on the right trajectory.  While we obviously must take account of scientific findings and take on board what we are told, in many ways, we must fine-tune how we bring people along.  Everybody has a part to play but I refer to what happens sometimes when climate change is being discussed.  Everybody seems to get excited about the Paris climate accord and agreement but when it comes to individual choices people cannot see that they can make a difference.  Sometimes, where they can make a difference, they choose not to do so.  The Government must create policies that will encourage people to change their lifestyles.  In terms of energy usage, all of our business and lifestyles have emanated from the fact that we discovered oil.  Many technologies have stemmed from that discovery and it could be argued that if we had diversified at an earlier stage we would be in a different position and would have avoided a number of wars as well. One attitude that sometimes comes across, and I mean no disrespect, is that one is urged to stop doing this and that and it seems like we must pull back.  The reality for us, as politicians who deal with people, is that people expect certain lifestyles now in the agriculture sector or in terms of the type of car one has or how power is used in the home.  Anything where we tell people to stop and switch off is often viewed as a backward step.  Of course the message has been conveyed that people can save money by conserving energy but I am impressed more by new solutions.  A very simple solution has been the advent of light emitting diodes, LEDs, and lighting and electricity has become a lot more efficient, cheaper etc.  Solutions that prove meaningful to people must involve all of the technology.  It not good enough just to tell people that Armageddon is coming because people just throw up their hands and decide to carry on as normal and, unfortunately, that is the message that people are given. Energy is a major part of agriculture too.  I hail from a part of the country that has a lot of natural renewable energy resources such as wind and wave energy.  The wind energy sector on land has been developed more.  I have often thought that when we were developing projects, there were no experts around to identify where projections should be developed.  Instead, poli­ ticians attended public meetings where we encountered people who objected to such develop­ ment.  It is all very well to say, at a high level, that we should achieve this.  I have heard calls to crush the farming way of life but that is unrealistic.  Instead, people switch off and do not participate in an innovative fashion.  Some people have even called for farmers not to keep livestock any more.  Such people are negative towards the many positive things that farmers do or are involved in and have been contradicted in terms of the dairy sector.  Ireland has the most carbon efficient dairy production sector in Europe and Ireland is fifth in beef production.  Every aspect of farmers’ lives are affected by climate change.  Environmental requirements must be satisfied before farmers can draw down payments and farmers are heavily penalised if they do not comply with the rules stipulated by Europe.  All of that must be acknowledged in terms of farming. I note that Deputy Penrose has left the meeting.  Mr. Lumley mentioned fodder shortages. Ireland, as a country, has natural advantages when rearing bovine animals.  Therefore, is it re­ alistic to expect Irish farmers to grow more plant-based food crops?  My understanding is it is easier to grow protein crops in the tropics, for example, than here.  I imagine that attempts to grow some of those crops here would not be successful.  Is that not a reality, from the climate point of view, in respect of how we live and in terms of what our diets require? As for how targets will be achieved, an awful lot of targets have been discussed at a higher level.  The Irish Government is regularly bashed for not meeting its targets.  I believe this coun­ try should be sustainable in its approach to all things and it is a good economic move as well. Recently there have been media announcements about hybrid vehicles and manufacturing in China and India.  Ireland has to meet many targets such as Food Wise 2025.  The food sector is a major employer in rural Ireland and is a considerable part of the Irish economy.  How do the witnesses reconcile that fact with having a transition blueprint and who pays for all of this while bearing in mind the current realities we are facing? My next question is on the local authorities.  It seems that we need to bring things down to a more local level.  Do the witnesses envisage more of a role for local authorities in that regard? I appreciate that they have environmental sections and work with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and so on but can they have more of a role in trying to achieve some of our tar­ gets, whether through education or otherwise?  What might that involve or is it feasible? As regards the marine, Dr. Heffernan referred to the €6.4 billion growth target in terms of Ireland’s ocean economy.  Mr. Lumley discussed the expansion of the beef and dairy industry and set out that our targets in that regard are not sustainable.  As regards targets in terms of the marine, does Dr. Heffernan think that harnessing our ocean wealth is being future-proofed in terms of climate change?  If so, how is that progressing?  Could some of what is being imple­ mented or encouraged by the Marine Institute be brought to bear on agriculture?  What advice would Dr. Heffernan offer on the dilemma with which we are faced in that regard? ",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome the opportunity to engage with the Minister in advance of the budget.  I want to ask for increased support in the budget for the development of the sports horse industry.  It has great potential to generate business in rural areas where we are looking for ideas to retain communities.  There is already significant interest in sports horses. I believe some plans have been presented to the Minister and funds will be needed to assist in those.  I hope we will see something that would be meaningful for local economies in rural Ireland develop from that. In order to ensure genetic diversity in Irish rare breeds in accordance with our EU obliga­ tions, there are complaints from the Irish Rare Breeds Society that the support it has received from the Department is minimal, not meaningful and not impactful.  What is the Minister look­ ing for in this budget for them?  What is his view on supporting them further? My biggest concern here today is the suckler cow.  I know the Minister wants to support the beef sector and the suckler farmers.  I acknowledge the measures that are there, the beef data and genomics scheme, the establishment of the beef producer organisations, all the new markets the Minister has worked towards opening, alongside Bord Bia and all the other mea­ sures that help.  The truth is, notwithstanding all the efforts, morale is very low among suckler cow farmers.  In the west and north-west, where I am located, we have not had the worst of the weather this summer, in fact we probably had the best of the weather, a combination of sun and rain and we do not have the fodder problem.  Over the past few years, however, we have been battling an extended winter every year.  We have had fodder shortages and the fodder crisis last year.  There are pressures on slurry storage and spreading, poor factory prices and poor prices at the mart.  We also have cash flow problems.  Brexit, Mercosur, and climate action measures will be laid upon farmers, including the threat hanging over them of a carbon tax..  There is evidence to be concerned about the sustainability of the suckler cow herd’s future and, unless there is intervention right now, there will be problems in the future.  The farming organisations have been ventilating the situation of these farmers.  From what I can see, and to judge from the figures produced by the farmers I have met and their personal situations, they are making little or no money or are losing money and if they did not get other farm payments they would be in a desperate situation.  This is backed up by the Department’s Food Wise 2015 beef group which is recommending further supports for sucklers and I would support this also. When I talk about farmers setting out their income an example is the farmer showing me that it costs him €900 a year to keep his suckler cow yet when he sells the calf he gets €850.  I do not know why or how anybody would or could sustain that.  Reality will bite.  The reality is that farming is a vocation and while the older and more mature farmer may stick with the voca­ tion to the end, the younger generation may not.  I know the Minister says we need to encourage younger farmers, whether in respect of land mobility or otherwise but in another case, a suckler cow farmer who has 80 head of cattle contacted me; his son is 30 years old and is very interested in and loves farming.  He bought an old house for €60,000 which he needs to do up.  He went to the bank where he was more or less laughed at.  The bank told him he would not get a cent based on any of his accounts.  He has a trade and was told to go back to his trade because that would be the only way he could ever hope to get a mortgage or to build any future for himself.  There is no future in that suckler cow farm the way he sees it now.  Unless farmers have other work there is no great incentive for them.   The day will come when younger people walk away from this because they have had more education opportunities and have better options.  That does not suit us or our country.  It is no secret that the average age of farmers, especially suckler cow farmers, is quite high.  If the young farmers do not take up the baton the suckler cow numbers will plummet.  I am not being alarmist, all the facts are stacking up towards this.  I know the Minister wants to support the beef sector but I believe that if this happens and the suckler cow herd plummets, where I live in the west and north-west will be unrecognisable.  In the west 81% of cows are suckler cows.  I think in Mayo they account for 84%, in Roscommon and Leitrim, 93%.  That is from a report conducted by the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the National University of Ireland Cork, NUIC.  The suckler cow is the basic production machine for a vast industry, not only are we getting traceable quality and affordable food but if the numbers drop from the percentages that I have quoted we can forget about the meat factories, the marts, the merchants in my area, the vets, and all the spin-off industries from the suckler cow.  I welcome payments on the areas of natural constraint, ANC, and the increase, which is very important but dairy people get that same payment.  What is needed at this juncture is a targeted payment in this budget.  We have to be realistic about the Common Agricultural Policy and look forward. I know the Minister has talked about the constraints and the challenges and that he is fighting with the Commissioner, Phil Hogan and the whole of Government but we need a targeted pay­ ment in the budget recognising the pressures the suckler cow farmer is under, which are well documented, but also the significance and importance of the suckler cow.  It is absolutely criti­ cal where I am from.  I am in no doubt about it.  We can talk about towns and villages and all the rest, but the fabric of rural Ireland is the suckler cow and it is critical that there is action to support the farmers.  At the very least a signal should be given in this budget that there is hope and that they fit into the bigger scheme.  This is a critical, pivotal time for the suckler cow farmer.  Notwithstanding any campaigns that farm organisations run, again and again people tell me their stories of sons and daughters and their own circumstances and they are fed up. They are not people fighting with me about Government.  We need to act because there is an awful lot at stake here.",

  "Exact Text": "Would the Chairman like to come with me to a meeting with the Minister for Finance later? I thank all the contributors for their questions.  The beef and suckler cow sector is one of the main issues raised.  That is understandable but it was not until Senator Mulherin and Deputy Murphy raised the issue that the climate change context was raised as well.  Very often the De­ partment is accused, rightly or wrongly, of not having joined-up thinking.  It is imperative that anything we do, whether budgetary or at CAP level is consistent with the obligations we face under challenging targets for reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.  That is something I am acutely conscious of in the context of the sector.  An effectively coupled payment of €200 per cow is the demand, and although I have heard it described as a targeted payment on every cow, it is not the direction we should go in the context of our climate change obligations. We need to make sure that, whatever we do, we are consistent with the direction of travel we have been going in the context, for example, of the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, which aims to drive efficiencies in the herd and improve its genetic merit and I am conscious of that.  I am in the middle of the overall budget figures.  I cannot go any further than that but I am aware of the issues for the sector, as I am for the broader farming community.  Anything done at any level has to be done within that framework, otherwise we would, rightly, be open to the charge that we were not being consistent and a coupled payment is not the direction we should consider travelling. Senator Lombard asked if I see the climate change agenda as a threat to agriculture.  It could well be but I also think we are starting from a position of strength in the debate.  There is no one issue that will resolve all this. Deputy Murphy asked about renewable energy, whether anaerobic digestion or solar pan­ els.  We have to be open to all of those initiatives, whether milk recording or BDGP, the use of sexed semen, protected urea or anaerobic digestors.  The range of issues, from sequestration to new technologies to monetising the value of waste, will have to be invoked to enable us to meet the targets.  It could be said that, with the exception of BDGP and the green low carbon agri- environment scheme, GLAS, the last CAP did not drive that agenda sufficiently.  Certainly the next one will.  What is on the table now is putting far more conditionality on payments in the future.  The smart farm programme is a collaboration between the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and it shows that where farmers embrace these on-farm initiatives they deliver a good story in terms of sustainability but they also deliver from a financial perspective.  They make the farmers more profitable.  We need to work harder at demystifying all this talk about sustainability and talk about the practical things.  For exam­ ple, one of the biggest challenges we face almost immediately is ammonia emissions.  Simple things like moving to the trailing shoe or the splash plate deliver very significant improvements, as does protected urea as opposed to calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN.  I appreciate there is a price differential there but it has been suggested to me, and this is worth exploring, that if the volume of CAN or protected urea rose significantly then the differential might drop and there is a significant dividend from that.  They are things we can do in bite-size approaches to the sustainability agenda.  It will not necessarily be the new quota on the dairy side.  I acknowledge what has been done by the dairy industry to anticipate the challenges but we will all have to do more. The Department will have to lead.  That is right because it would be financially punitive not to do so.  The market is also saying we need to do this.  That is increasingly the request in the markets we want to be in, where there are consumers with higher spending power who are asking about the sustainability credentials in the broader definition of sustainability, such as en­ vironmental and welfare issues, and anti-microbial resistance, which are all part of this.   Con­ sumers in those markets with higher spending power are asking about sustainability credentials under the broader definition of “sustainability”, including environmental sustainability, welfare issues, antimicrobial resistance and so on.  All that is part of this agenda.  As with farming more generally, we can find a solution within that framework that enables us to meet those targets, challenging as they are, while also protecting the family farm structure.  Much of it goes back to the question of an adequate CAP budget. Senator Lombard raised the matter of the TB forum.  The challenge for that forum is to come up with evidence-based policy recommendations that will enable us to achieve the objective of eliminating TB by 2030.  It is a substantial challenge and represents a substantial budgetary line in my Department on an annual basis.  While the overall incidence of TB is going down, the size of individual herds is increasing significantly and, therefore, the cost of a herd outbreak is greater than it would have been in the past.  The Department appreciates the efforts of farmers in this area over the years.  We are on the cusp of achieving the complete elimination of TB but it requires a final push from everybody.  The forum is the right thing at the right time and I have no doubt that its current members and Chairman will do a good job. The Senator also referred to the fishing industry.  In essence, what the fishing industry - unlike farming - faces in the event of a calamitous Brexit is having its field taken away.  In es­ sence, that is what is involved because we catch 60% of our most valuable stock, mackerel, in what is deemed to be UK territorial waters as well as 40% of our second most valuable stock. A full third of the total value of the Irish industry is in UK waters.  In a way, that debunks the argument that the industry was short-changed in terms of EU membership.  The Irish fishing industry benefitted from the fact that it could fish in other waters and make a profit.  We are clued into this issue in the context of our Brexit negotiations and will work side by side with the fishing industry, both the catching and the processing arms, on it.  Our position is exactly the same as that of the industry and we are working with all of the equally affected member states that have an exposure to catching stocks in UK territorial waters.  We have fed our analysis into the Barnier task force and our position is shared by all of the programme officers.  As I said earlier, I hope there will be a profitable outcome on it. Some members raised the ANC issue.  We allocated an additional €25 million in funding to that scheme this year, with €13 million going to mountain-type land, €9 million to severely handicapped land and €3 million to less severely handicapped land.  That means that those farming mountain-type land will see their payments increase from €109.71 to €135 on the first 10 ha.  Payments have issued to some farmers and others will receive payments as they meet the stocking requirement.  Payments will increase from €95 to €112 for those farming severely handicapped land.  This is a significant and focused increase.  Senator Muherin referred to the fact that dairy farmers receive payments under the ANC scheme but tillage farmers do not, even though there are some tillage farmers on ANC-type land.  To put that observation in a broader context, the challenge with regard to CAP reform is to direct resources such that they deliver the greatest dividend.  Proposals on how those scarce resources can be best targeted are awaited from all of the farming organisations.    Deputy Eugene Murphy raised the issue of drainage schemes.  I would love to have a better answer for him but, in the context of climate change, the suggestions in some quarters are to re-wet lands rather than drain them.",

  "Exact Text": "The facts clearly indicate there is no underspend and that the opposite is the case.  There is an overspend of at least €105 million and if we include areas of natural constraint, it could be significantly higher, perhaps as high as €227 million.  If the Deputy’s support for the suckler sector is predicated on an underspend in the rural development programme, God help the suckler sector because there is no underspend. A number of specific issues were raised.  It is said that the devil can cite scripture for his own purpose and I will play devil’s advocate for that reason.  Not for the first time, Deputy McConalogue alluded to a press statement issued by the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, in which he announced the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  If the Deputy has the document in front of him, he will see that the Minister also stated that the scheme had a maximum of €5,000, with a GLAS+ top-up of €2,000.  It was estimated there would initially be 30,000 participants, with an additional 20,000 participants, leaving 50,000 people in the scheme.  That figure has been achieved.  That is clearly the extent of the commitment.  The Deputy seems to be implying that for some reason the rural development programme should not honour the contractual commitments that existed in other agri-environment schemes, including the agri-environment options scheme and the rural environment protection scheme, as the car­ ryover from the previous scheme.  They were very substantial financial carryover obligations, as I mentioned in my opening remarks.  We originally estimated the expenditure would be in the region of €630 million and the outturn is showing a figure of just under €600 million.  The carried over liability is approximately €599 million.  There was no uncertainty whatever in the Minister’s statement.  There would be 50,000 participants, with a payment to a maximum of €5,000 and a top-up for those eligible for GLAS+ of €2,000.  If the Deputy quotes from a state­ ment, he might quote from all of it in the interests of accuracy. The Deputy asked a number of other questions, including on the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP.  We reopened the BDGP and approved all applications.  No one was turned away.  We had greater ambition for the scheme but it is true that there were significant head­ winds.  If I recall, the Deputy was not behind the door in encouraging those headwinds against the scheme and some of the farm organisations were equally critical.  They subsequently be­ came champions of the scheme and campaigned to open it again.  The campaign against the detail of the scheme caused confusion about its merits, at the very least.  We would have liked to have had more participants but when the scheme was reopened, the number of applications did not match our ambition.  Currently, there are 24,600 applicants.  It is a good scheme, which will deliver for the beef industry in terms of carbon efficiency, profitability, etc.  We opened it and approved all applications. Deputy McConalogue asked a specific question on GLAS carryover post-2020.  My in­ formation is that this would refer primarily to GLAS 3 applicants, of which there are approxi­ mately 12,000.  The cost of that carryover post-2020 will be in the region of €50 million. The Deputy also raised a question about the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS.  We have a total outstanding commitment of more than €100 million for 10,000 farmers who have current approvals issued but the work has not been completed or the Department has not been notified that a claim is to be submitted.  We moved from a three-year approval process to a process of 12-month approval.  With plant, the approval process is six months in duration. This gives a better capacity to track who is doing what.  The first of the three-year approvals expires towards the end of this year.  This will give us a better opportunity to profile the de­ mand on the expenditure.  We have just concluded an application round for which interest was substantial.  We recently closed tranche 10 and it is anticipated there will be 20 tranches under TAMS, each lasting three months.  We anticipate significant demand for capital investment of the type envisaged under TAMS and there are various categories, ranging from low-emission slurry spreading to young farmers to tillage.  There is a list of six or seven headings under which approval will be made.  Two further tranches will be opened this year. I take Deputy Cahill’s point about delays in approvals.  To be honest, it is difficult to envis­ age an application being submitted in the current tranche, which has only just closed, asking for approval to put down a slab for first-cut silage.  There is the old Irish saying “Ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb”, or it is not the windy day you thatch the roof.  There is a period in which an ap­ plication is processed.  We make every effort to do so but to be applying in the current tranche for slab for first-cut silage is a bit ambitious.  The departmental staff will try to accommodate people in most cases. Deputy Cahill raised the issue of sheep tagging and EID, which is the best available technol­ ogy in the context of traceability, market access and food safety.  We now have the FSA report. I have never shrunk from saying there is a cost but there is also a labour saving device and it is much more effective for traceability than the current regime.  Transposing 13-digit numbers onto despatch documents is not conducive to accuracy.  We have engaged with a lot of stake­ holders around all these issues and I am convinced it is the right thing to do and will deliver for the industry in the shape of market access and other gains. Deputy Cahill also raised the issue of the hen harrier scheme.  I have designated land in my constituency so I understand his concerns.  I am delighted to have reinstated a scheme which was dropped by a previous Administration in 2008 or 2009 at the height of the crash.  I never said it would be the sole vehicle to address the issue raised by Deputy Cahill as there is a blanket ban on afforestation, which is the subject of a long and tortuously slow threat response plan be­ ing delivered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I have been in contact with the relevant Minister and there has been engage­ ment with stakeholders recently that might see some potential for afforestation in some areas, and though the details are yet to be spelled out I have always said a combination of both things could deliver a comprehensive response for landowners.  The Deputy also asked about TAMS assistance for milk tanks.  TAMS has always been a form of grant aid for purchase and that is the problem.  I know there is a tradition in the area of co-operative involvement. Deputy Kenny referred to GLAS and we have engaged at length on GLAS payments.  While there are issues in the Department, the overwhelming majority of cases where payment has not been made are cases where we await the submission of documentation from clients.  There are a few cases that might have come through appeals processes or where there were changes in actions on particular plots and they all require resolution by the Department but the Department is working through payment details. The Deputy spoke about an underspend but there is, in fact, a substantial anticipated over­ spend in the rural development programme of €160 million.  People whose membership of the AEOS scheme is expiring had the opportunity to transfer into GLAS but because the rural development funding is overspent there is now no opportunity to reopen the scheme.  There is a hierarchy in terms of qualifying and in terms of the environmental assets which we prioritise and we told people in previous schemes that they could switch over.  With the funding now having been committed, however, we would have to take funding from other areas to reopen GLAS.  Due to the overspend of €105 million and a possible areas of natural constraint, ANC, overspend of €227 million, the latitude is not there now. I have dealt with the suckler cow scheme.  Our shared objective is to support the beef sector and somebody referred to the recent Teagasc farm incomes data showing two faces to agriculture - one the very successful commercial dairy side, and to a lesser extent tillage, the other the low-income livestock and beef sector.  The challenge for the next rural development programme is to find the optimal way to support that sector and I look forward to engaging with this committee on the post-2020 CAP in this context.  The detail of the new schemes will be worked on in the immediate period ahead. Deputy Kenny asked about the Leader programme.  I do not want to trespass on other ministerial areas and we effectively act as a postbox in relation to the Leader programme.  The funding comes through the rural development programme but it is spent and organised by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  I know from speaking to Leader groups in my own constituency that it has been particularly slow but I suggest it is not so different from previous rural development programmes, which cranked up slowly and then took off.   I understand that about €5 million of the €250 million has already been spent, although I may be wrong.  There was a substantial reorganisation of the Leader groups because, with less fund­ ing being available, they wanted to reduce overhead costs and concentrate whatever scarce re­ sources were available on projects at the coalface.  A lot of the reorganisation took longer than people anticipated but it has now been concluded and in my own area I have seen the beginning of projects coming through the pipeline and getting funding.  I suspect that will accelerate in the months ahead.",

  "Exact Text": "I am sure Ms McCarthy noted in November that the Citizens’ Assembly delivered a damning indictment of Irish agriculture.  I think 89% called for a tax on greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture.  Was Bord Bia invited to present at the Citizens’ As­ sembly?  What is its view in relation to that particular proposition and, to me, the very negative view put on the efforts being made by farmers to address greenhouse gas emissions? The other issue then is on the Origin Green side.  I understand that 60% of the feedstuffs fed to dairy cows, beef cattle, pigs and sheep is imported.  That is increasing year-on-year.  How confident is Bord Bia that this will not affect our food standards?  How can we stand over the quality of the foods we are bringing in when we are promoting our own for export?  We are promoting foods of a certain standard in the context of sustainability, etc.  Of particular concern is the fact that, in respect of the 9 million tonnes of feed consumed, most of the 6 million tonnes imported is made from genetically modified soya and maize.  Is that correct?  If that is the case, surely we need an increase in output from the tillage sector to counter this trend.  I understand that already in the German market there are demands that no food, including cheese, butter and beef, be tainted by genetically modified feed.  The food chain is already being examined there. I would welcome Ms McCarthy’s observations on the matter. How does Ms McCarthy foresee the tillage sector growing in the future?  Representatives of the sector outlined the challenges and the committee drew up a report.  The sector is making a very positive contribution in the use of the environment as a carbon sink.  I would appreciate Ms McCarthy’s response on the matter.",

  "Exact Text": "Regarding Senator Lombard’s point on Mercosur and what hap­ pens next on the dairy side, there are ongoing contacts between officials from the EU and Mercosur countries.  As I understand it, there are a number of issues to do with automobiles, geographical indicators, dairy access and ethanol.  There is a lot of contention around those issues at the moment.  We are looking for greater liberalisation and access on the dairy side. However, there is a lot of official interaction at the moment on both sides.  At some point, in the not too distant future, because of impending elections in Brazil, there will be a requirement that the Brazilian team step down.  That will put a pause in the negotiations, if they were not concluded by that stage. Deputy Kenny and Deputy Penrose made a point earlier about standards.  We have deployed all the arguments raised here about sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, standards in Brazilian beef and the problems the Commission uncovered and that have been the subject of investigation in Brazil.  We have deployed all of those arguments around the carbon footprint etc.  We are using every leverage we can to our advantage in these debates.  Mercosur countries currently have access to the EU market.  They are exporting substantial volumes of beef in here from approved plants.  They are approved by the Food and Veterinary Office of the EU.  They have to meet those requirements.  Obviously, in Brazil, not all of those requirements have been met and there have been consequences because of recent events that have been uncovered.  However, they do currently have access to the European market.  This is about additional access, if conceded in the context of Mercosur.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome the UCD research team.  I thank its members for the interesting presentation.  It is clear that they are involved in cutting-edge work.  I commend them and their stakeholders on their work. It is a great source of pride to most Irish people that we are world leaders when it comes to food and innovation.  As others have mentioned, instead of letting it become a twilight industry we have embraced it.  We have the necessary roots in it.  I am mindful of all the work being done with Irish companies by our guests.  It is indigenous work of which we can be proud on the world stage.  I know those involved in UCD have to keep working with science and technology and I know that is what they are about. There has been talk of the dairy industry.  The deputation mentioned tillage and soil in the context of getting increasing productivity.  To what extent does UCD work with primary pro­ ducers?  In particular, to what extent does UCD work with suckler cow farmers or sheep farm­ ers?  It is implicit in talk about the future for young farmers that there seems to be a more upbeat approach in dairy, especially with regard to younger people and the possibilities.  Many farmers have small marginal holdings in the west of Ireland.  It is not that people are not doing their best.  It is not that there is no pride in what people are doing or in their communities.  However, it is more challenging.  The last winter was extended.  Thankfully, it has well evaporated now but it tested many people.  I imagine that it made younger people wonder why they would do it. I will explain why I am asking about the extent to which UCD works with primary produc­ ers.  Our guests referred to systems and improving production.  In the case of diary, UCD is looking at the existing system.  The idea is to take what the primary producer produces and then develop by-products to displace plastics made from fossil fuels and so on.  To what extent is UCD dependent on the existing system and the fact that the primary producer does not get paid much in the food supply chain? Is it not the case that the price supports we pursue and that operate under CAP are an integral part of the equation?  Is it not the case that UCD is really building on that?  If we did not have CAP or price supports and so on, then would the UCD model be completely different?  Other than in the abstract, how does UCD address the issues around the price the primary producer is receiving?  I know there have been high-level reports and investigations at EU level.  How­ ever, the reality is that unless we address this, problems will arise.  Younger people have more options and they are more educated.  They may go into the food industry but perhaps not as primary producers. Did UCD make submissions on the new CAP to the Commission?  Is that part of the role of UCD?  Does UCD feed in at that level? Reference was made to dairy by-products or bio-based alternatives to adhesives and plastics. How does that work with carbon credits?  Has that not been considered yet?  Of course, farmers and food production keep getting hammered for carbon emissions and carbon efficiency.  Is that something that can be credited to farming? Reference was made to how 30% of the world population is malnourished.  Is that the cor­ rect figure?  I realise that our guests did not go into detail on it.  In any event, I understand that more people are probably going to die from obesity than from starvation.  There is irony in the fact that in developed countries such as ours, where there is so much emphasis on food and nutrition as well as a great deal of investment in food, people are becoming more obese.  While people may be eating more calories and food is more calorific, it is not necessarily nutritious. That is a serious problem for health and well-being.  I believe it spills over into mental health as well.  Do our guests have any observations on this contradiction?  When I go to the supermar­ ket, I can buy processed food far cheaper than anything else.  I know we are talking about how to get money to the primary producer but food such as that to which I refer is generally cheaper. More nutritious food seems to be more expensive.  We have heard in evidence at other sessions of the growing market for organic food and that people are prepared to pay more.  However, it seems only people of a particular socioeconomic background are taking that on.  There seems to be many people left behind.  What we eat and what we put into our bodies is part of living. Notwithstanding the work of UCD, it seems that we are being pulled back.  A sugar tax was imposed in respect of pop drinks and so on in an attempt to combat the problem but it is clearly an issue.  I am aware that sugar is addictive.  We find ourselves in an interesting state of affairs where we cannot stop eating once we start or are eating the wrong food and so on.",

  "Exact Text": "On 9 May, which was Europe Day, a joint sitting of this com­ mittee and the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine held an interesting debate. Dr. Sinéad McCarthy from Teagasc appeared before us.  We considered the questions of food and carbon emissions from our beef industry.  One issue that arose related to how most of the plant-based protein foods that we might rely on as alternatives to meat were imported.  This was striking.  None of those foods that one buys from Tesco or some other shops is made in Ireland. My understanding is that our soil and climate are not best suited to the types of crop in question. Such crops would have to be imported.  If they are coming from the tropics, then we are talking about developing countries that face their own food shortage challenges and about the carbon footprint of bringing the food to Ireland. Dr. McCarthy expanded on the notions that we were best placed to get our protein from meat and dairy as opposed to beans and other plant-based protein crops, given that our cattle were grass fed, and that, as one got older, one would have to eat more beans to meet one’s protein requirements compared with meat.  Perhaps these are not matters that the council has considered, but they need further discussion.  The issue of food is emotive and the debate has not been expanded upon enough.  The debate has been slanted by people who have not looked into it enough, and while there is a bigger discussion in the round, beef is getting a bashing.  At the end of the day, though, we have to eat food.  There are many dimensions to this issue.",

  "Exact Text": "It is to do with the better energy warmer homes scheme and how we are going to fund retrofitting.  I know of private sector contractors doing this work. Plenty of people are willing to do it.  I do not know what the deficit is.  Not only is future work being put on hold, contractors are not being paid for the work they have done.  They wait for months.  There is a problem in the SEAI, and I would like a clarification on when they will be paid.  People are looking for their houses to be retrofitted.  When will that be done? Finally, I welcome the approach taken in agriculture whereby we will seek to implement the objectives in the Teagasc report, which provides a roadmap for this sector.  Agriculture is big in our county because we do not have heavy industry.  That is why it accounts for so much of our emissions.  Several members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I had occasion to meet delegations from China, Russia and other countries outside the Eu­ ropean Union.  They do not have a bit of interest in carbon emissions reduction.  They wanted to compare notes on the experiences and challenges of farmers.  Their farmers do not have the equivalent of the CAP.  However I would like further strides to be made in recognising the ef­ forts made to date by our farmers in the dairy and beef sectors and across the board in reducing carbon emissions per unit.  Our farmers should be championed for more carbon-efficient pro­ duction.   Food is not an optional extra.  We need to eat and we want our food to be produced in the most carbon-efficient way.  Our farmers should be championed for their efforts in that regard.  There will be a big challenge in terms of our farmers being crucified over climate ac­ tion while countries with which we compete and which are bigger markets into which we sell really do not care.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus. Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter’s climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils’ parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State pro­ vided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be. There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot con­ tinue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accord­ ingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the ad­ ditional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses’ message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people’s concerns. I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.  The issue of community gain is very relevant there. There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situa­ tion where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging. I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are do­ ing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process. We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that. The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerg­ ing economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity for my colleagues, Dr. O’Mara and Dr. Kelly, and I to address the committee this afternoon.  The committee asked us to focus on our 2018 annual report and on our current and future plans.  I do not propose to read the statement in its entirety; I will just focus on some of the key points. Last year, Teagasc’s total expenditure was €185 million and this year, we anticipate an out­ turn of €186 million.  Approximately 70% of the total was funded through grant-in-aid, and that is 60% when expenditure on pensions is excluded.  Teagasc is unique among non-commercial State-sponsored bodies in having sizeable expenditure funded though non-grant-in-aid sourc­ es, including advisory and education fees, farm receipts, services to industry, industry levies, and receipts from its successful participation in competitive research programmes.  Currently, Teagasc employs approximately 1,262 permanent and contract staff.  We have approximately 248 researchers, but not included in that total are 253 Walsh fellows, mainly at PhD level, and approximately 40 masters’ students being trained on agricultural extension programmes, in collaboration with University College Dublin, UCD.  Under our advisory programme, we have approximately 300 front-line advisers across all farming enterprises at our 51 advisory offices. Some 140 of these are in dry stock, mainly beef; 89 are in dairying; and 16 are in tillage.  We have 76 subject matter specialists and these are a critical group of staff in that they provide a bridge between research knowledge and its on-farm adoption through our front-line advisory services.  Despite a significant reduction in the number of advisers over the past decade, we have maintained a client base of approximately 43,000.  In addition, of course, we provide a service to all farmers. The Teagasc education system is delivered through Teagasc’s four colleges and three affili­ ated privately-owned colleges.  We also partner with many institutes of technology, UCD and, more recently, University College Cork, UCC, to deliver higher level programmes.  We have approximately 1,700 students enrolled in our colleges at present.  College enrolments have slowed in recent years as the economic recovery has taken hold, but this trend has been sub­ stantially offset by enrolments in our part-time programmes delivered across our 12 advisory regions.  Approximately 100,000 students are enrolled in these part-time programmes.  That is about twice the level that prevailed prior to the establishment of the various incentivisation measures in the rural development programme, RDP, of the current CAP.  In addition, Teagasc delivered a wide range of short courses to almost 6,500 people in rural areas. In recent years, the agency has also set up an education and training programme known as ConnectEd.  It is dedicated to the needs of rural professionals, such as private agricultural con­ sultants, agribusiness, banks and other financial institutions.  This service is the main vehicle through which we deliver, among other aspects of training, Teagasc’s nutrient management planning programme. I will briefly refer to some highlights in our reports, first from 2018 and then from this year. Last year was the year of the severe fodder crisis.  Teagasc’s advisers up and down the country played a major role in supporting farmers through that crisis, including clients and non-clients. We held a very successful open day in Grange in 2018 and this year there was a dairy open day in Cork.  They are held in alternate years.  There was also a crops open day at Oak Park.  All of those events attracted substantial attendance. In 2018, we published a major report, entitled Education Vision, on the future and long- term vision of agricultural education.  One of the main outcomes was implemented this year, whereby all students entering agricultural colleges now must spend a minimum of two years in college before they can qualify at level 6.  This year also saw the first students enrolled into the new Teagasc-UCC bachelor of agricultural science.  This is a third-level programme that will be delivered at UCC and at Teagasc’s Moorepark and Clonakilty campuses.  Last year and this year, with the support of the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, we organised a series of smart consent workshops. On the research front, Teagasc led a successful consortium through Science Foundation Ireland, SFI.  This endeavour was also supported by significant funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This centre is known as the VistaMilk SFI Research Centre and it will engage in groundbreaking research on the application of precision-based systems across the dairy value chain, with an emphasis on pasture-based agriculture.  This investment is worth approximately €40 million over six years, comprised of public and private funding, and approximately 40 companies are participating in the project. As far as Horizon 2020 funds are concerned, Teagasc was successful in 2018 and 2019.  We were ranked as the fifth most successful applicant for that funding in 2018 and third in 2019. The greenhouse gases abatement report was also published in 2018, popularly known as the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC.  This formed the basis of the Government’s agricultural measures in its climate action plan published in June 2019.  The agricultural sup­ port and advisory programme, ASAP, was also initiated in 2018 to address water quality on the nation’s farms.  It is a joint initiative of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Teagasc and the dairy co-operatives.  Teagasc has 20 advisers dedicated to the programme, with the co-operatives providing an additional ten. This service is provided free of charge to farmers. Substantial investment is being put in place to enable Ireland to be Brexit-ready.  The chal­ lenge associated with Brexit is to encourage food companies to diversify their exports and this will require significant innovation.  With private and public support, Teagasc is investing €30 million in three major initiatives.  These include the extension of its Moorepark Technology Limited pilot plant, at a cost of €10 million, the establishment of a prepared consumer food centre at Teagasc Ashtown, Castleknock, also at a cost of €10 million, and the investment of some €9 million, provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in the de­ velopment of what we call a food innovation hub at Teagasc Moorepark.  Construction on that facility recently commenced. Finally, looking forward to 2020, in the first quarter, Teagasc will launch its statement of strategy that will cover the period 2020-2022.  We will also publish our regular sectoral road­ maps and these will provide an important input into the Government’s successor to Food Wise 2025.  A key objective for us next year will be to implement the Teagasc recommendations as published in the Government’s climate action plan for the mitigation of greenhouse gases and ammonia.  This will involve an intensive advisory campaign.  We also intend that all Teagasc research and college farms will adhere to the highest standards of sustainability and we will launch a plan to secure sustainable profitability across the beef sector.  There will be continued focus on good calf management on dairy farms to ensure the good health and welfare of calves and also a focus on working closely with dairy farmers to improve the beef quality of calves through the use of the dairy-beef index and sex semen. A major open day on beef will be held in Grange next year and there will also be a sheep open day at Athenry.  We intend to progress research on antimicrobial and anthelmintic resis­ tance.  Teagasc also plans next year to consolidate and enhance our research programme on the sustainable circular bio-economy, especially in the area of food.  As I mentioned earlier, we plan to complete the construction of the food innovation hub at Teagasc Moorepark.  We also intend to continue our support for Irish Aid’s development efforts in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Vietnam.  I left out one measure and my apologies for that.

  "Exact Text": "I will take some of the points and my colleagues can pick up on anything that I do not get around to dealing with.  Senator Daly raised a very important point on the incoming European Commission and the remarks of the President of the Commission recently on the green deal.  The protection of agriculture and the growth of chemical nitrogen, N, particularly on dairy farms in recent years, will be the key challenge for us and is clearly a cause of concern.  There are two strategies we would strongly advocate.  First, as referenced earlier by Dr. O’Mara, farmers need to be encouraged to move away from calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, to protected urea, which we recommend as the alternative because it has the same efficacy in terms of grass yield but it does not have the negative consequence of CAN in terms of ammonia and greenhouse emissions.  Second, for the long-term ability of the sector to harness the use of nitrogen, we need to encourage farmers to adopt clover in their swards.  We know from our research that currently the efficiency of chemical nitrogen on average is only 24%.  For every unit of nitrogen used only 24% is utilised to produce livestock products.  The remainder either goes into the atmosphere or into the ground water.  We know from our work in Clonakilty, for example, that greater use of clover in swards not only makes economic sense, it is worth approximately an additional €50 per cow in terms of additional milk solids, but most important from the environmental point of view, the efficiency increases from the average of 24% to 40%.  There is no question that there is a huge challenge in this area.  Nitrogen sales is an obvious indicator to which everyone can point.  We can talk all day long about the various promotion campaigns etc., but unless we can turn the curve in regard to chemical use it will continue to be an issue of contention and affect our ability to adhere to our ammonia and green­ house gas targets.  We have the technology to deal with it.  As in many areas of agriculture, the adoption of alternative practices is forever the challenge.  I noted at many of our recent confer­ ences an increasing awareness among farmers of the need to tackle these issues.  Hopefully, this will be manifest in actual decision-making on farms. Deputy Fitzmaurice raised a number of issues.  I do not have the figure relating to hedge­ rows.  Any such figure would be a highly speculative estimate because the hedgerows are varied in terms of species and that complicates any estimation.  We do not yet have an idea on the biomass involved let alone the variety of species, so I am not in a position to comment on the Deputy’s figure of 8%-10%.  There are many areas under continuous review as far as the so-called national inventory of greenhouse gases is concerned.  That is always the case.  As sciences evolve and provide us with more concrete results, that then leads to the incorporation of different estimates of sequestration potential and mitigation into the national inventory.  My own view would be that we are a long way off yet.  We are set on a path to 2030 in regard to the current inventory and the measures and targets.  Beyond that, one would hope that we will have the information that will enable us to broaden the sequestration options. The Deputy raised an important point in regard to the 43,000 farmers but, of course, that does not represent the totality.  As rightly stated by him, some farmers do not see the need for advisory support, which is fine, and they do not see the advantage in discussion groups or, maybe, they do not like participating in discussion groups.  There are a number of other farmers who exercise their entitlement to use private advisers.  As part of our work we hold a variety of open days, which is probably one of the main differences between ourselves and the private sector.  Everyone is invited and there is no cost involved.  In terms of breakdown, typically, it is 60-40.  In other words, 60% of the attendance typically are Teagasc clients and 40% would be non-clients.  All of the information that farmers receive on open days is freely available.  A similar ratio attend our marquee at the Ploughing Championships.  Naturally, we would like to have more but we are getting our message out through different fora. Dr. Kelly addressed the issue of the relationship with the ACA.  I reiterate his point that we are very open to having a memorandum of understanding if that would help the dialogue. Again, most of our research information is publicly available but we provide tailor-made pre­ sentations through our ConnectEd programme.  We see that as an efficient vehicle through which ACA members who want access to our latest research can get it.  I will ask Dr. O’Mara to comment on the issues around veganism, flexitarianism and so on.  Teagasc is absolutely convinced about the comprehensive and nutritional benefits of meat and dairy products, in re­ spect of which there is an abundance of evidence, such that there is no need for people to add supplements to create that well-rounded nutritional package we all need for our health.  More important, we know from our work that the grass based system provides additional nutritional value.  This has been well documented in recent years in our work at Moorepark. On the issue of low value calves, none of us here is unaware of this challenge.  It is a com­ plex issue.  I do not believe it is all down to jerseys.  There has been a huge change in recent times in the size of the calf because the dairy farmer wants an easy calving cow and a cow that will return to milk and fertility quickly.  Less than 20 years ago, we had a massive problem with fertility of our dairy cows.  It virtually collapsed.  We are only now reaching the point of recovering the position we were in before that collapse in fertility.  It was suggested that if we were to rid ourselves of the jerseys and jersey crosses, we would solve the issue.  We would not. Our preference is to examine the opportunities that exist for the selection of calves in the marts. It is important buyers have full and transparent information on the potential value of an animal, including its beef potential.  This will happen in the not too distant future.  We would also argue that in the selection of bulls for dairy cows in regard to their beef trades as per the dairy beef index, that within the spread of quality, farmers should choose the animal that best delivers the outcome in beef terms.  That is how it will happen in the future.  We all know that prior to the introduction of the dairy quota, 80% of beef was sourced from the dairy herd.  The percentage is now 60%, but it is growing.    It is inevitable that more dairy calves will come onto the market to be reared as beef animals.  That is a challenge for us all.  The options that the Deputy proposed are important.  We believe that a large contribution can be made in the rearing of dairy calves, but I take his point that some sort of combination might be attractive if we can get an animal that is that good.  One of the problems in the suckler sector is that the efficiency metrics are poor. We seem to have a real problem.  For example, one metric that has been stubbornly poor is the failure of many suckler cows to produce a calf per year.  That situation is worsening. The Deputy also raised the issue of derogations.  The derogation is important, but it ties into Senator Daly’s point about nitrogen.  Look north of the Border.  It is evident that, if we do not manage to implement the measures laid out in the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, there will be restrictions on nitrogen use in particular.  There is no question about it, as that is the easiest way to do it.  Due to the concerns about ammonia in Northern Ireland, the restrictions have virtually halted any development in the dairy industry there.  We are alert to that issue. I am not aware of the stocking rates that the Deputy mentioned.  Is Dr. O’Mara?",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus. Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter’s climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils’ parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State pro­ vided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be. There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot con­ tinue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accord­ ingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the ad­ ditional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses’ message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people’s concerns. I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.  The issue of community gain is very relevant there. There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situa­ tion where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging. I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are do­ ing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process. We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that. The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerg­ ing economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus. Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter’s climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils’ parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State pro­ vided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be. There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot con­ tinue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accord­ ingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the ad­ ditional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses’ message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people’s concerns. I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.  The issue of community gain is very relevant there. There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situa­ tion where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging. I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are do­ ing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process. We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that. The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerg­ ing economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus. Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter’s climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils’ parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State pro­ vided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be. There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot con­ tinue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accord­ ingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the ad­ ditional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses’ message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people’s concerns. I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.  The issue of community gain is very relevant there. There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situa­ tion where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging. I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are do­ ing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process. We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that. The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerg­ ing economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome our guests, who have spoken passionately.  These are issues that we considered in significant depth in writing our report.  Action is needed.  The requirement that we live more sustainably, which we have not been doing for years, is at the heart of this.  It is the fallout of industrialisation and so on.  If people were surveyed, everyone would agree with the targets under the Paris Agreement.  It is only when one starts to drill down into who will take the pain and cost that a problem arises.  That is what we must address if we want to see action.  As Deputy Neville stated, though, there must be a consensus. Recently, I attended a climate action forum of secondary schools in my county of Mayo that was facilitated by the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, GMIT, the county council and the latter’s climate action officer.  We were sitting around a table and one of the issues debated was that of cost.  In terms of transport, for example, we talked about how, if the pupils’ parents had to get electric vehicles, it would cost them money regardless of how large a grant the State pro­ vided.  The same would be the case with heating systems.  When I asked them if they believed that would be acceptable, they could not say that it would be. There is another political reality.  No matter what people say in the abstract about targets and the need to take action, the experience in Canada, Australia, Finland, France and Germany has been that, when politicians take political action, a large number of people do not agree with doing so.  It does not mean that we should balk at trying to do the right thing, as we cannot con­ tinue taking from the Earth something that will not be replenished and will cause greenhouse gas emissions.  We are smarter now and have more technology.  We must be smarter and live more smartly.  However, the idea that everyone is in agreement is incorrect.  It is not even that they do not believe that there is climate change.  Rather, they are more concerned with living in the here and now than with taking on additional pressures.  If someone is in receipt of social welfare payments, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can fund 100% of certain energy efficiency works on his or her house.  If someone is earning a low income and, accord­ ingly, will only receive partial supports, he or she will be under pressure.  These are the people who will be financing their children going to college.  From where will that money come?  The bill will be significant.  That is even evident from our social housing programme, given the ad­ ditional cost of building houses.  People are revolting against costs.  That does not take from the witnesses’ message, but we must refine our discussion to listening to people’s concerns. I have raised an issue previously and, while I do not want to labour the point, it must be borne in mind that when the witnesses refer to the measures that are necessary to tackle climate change, they are asking for more to be done by people living in rural areas.  They are asking rural areas to take wind farms and grid infrastructure.  They are asking for peat-burning power stations to be shut down.  Where I am from, such a station closed a number of years ago.  The area is only a shadow of its former itself economically.  The issue of community gain is very relevant there. There is also the issue of farming and the speaker from Teagasc earlier made a sensible proposition.  We are very well suited to producing protein from dairy and beef.  It does not mean that we continue exactly in the same vein but this is not discussed.  There is now a situa­ tion where farmers are saying they have been doing all of this.  The national herd has increased and that is why our greenhouse gases and emissions of methane have increased but farmers are farming more efficiently than ever before.  They are put to the pin of their collars by payments on environmental measures, water quality and biodiversity.  They have an appetite to do more but feel persecuted.  People are disengaging. I will say one final thing.  The generation coming after us ask us to look at what we are do­ ing.  The reality is that the parents of the children I was talking to would give their left arms for their children.  Their grandparents would do the same.  The generations that have come before are trying to cope and do their best.  They care and want to be given credit for that.  We have to get realistic solutions which balance idealism with the reality to achieve them and not crush people in the process. We will have a revolution.  It will not be like those revolting in London who are from more middle class backgrounds and have time on their hands.  The ordinary person will revolt which will create another set of problems that will set us back economically.  We cannot take from the advances and lifestyles we enjoy.  We must find technology to match that. The last speaker on the environment was positive and hopeful, as I am.  Human beings have great capacity to innovate and, although there will always be issues and problems, there can be business opportunities here.  We see a lot of signals sent out by China and India, major emerg­ ing economies, that they have to go to green technology and transport etc.  Ireland has to take these signals if it wants to participate in the global economy.  We must also be clever.   It is not only about misery, it is about opportunities and living in a different way.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank the committee for the invitation to address it today.  I am the policy co-ordinator of Stop Climate Chaos, which is an advocacy coalition for faster and fairer climate action.  We represent faith-based, development, environmental, social justice and community organisations throughout Ireland.  We welcome the initiative of the committee to discuss the role of agriculture in climate action.  As Professor Matthews highlighted, agriculture is responsible for 35% of Ireland’s annual greenhouse gas emissions and is the largest sectoral contributor to Ireland’s overall climate impact. The EPA stated in its most recent emission projection reports that emissions from the sec­ tor are increasing and that they are driven by increasing dairy cattle numbers and associated nitrogen inputs.  The dairy sector currently contributes half of all of Ireland’s agricultural green­ house gas emissions and has been driving the increase in agricultural emissions in recent years. Recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, data show that there was a 41% increase in the number of dairy cows between 2010 and 2019, making Ireland an outlier in comparison to other EU member states.  We find it worrying to note that the Teagasc dairy strategy to 2027 envisages yet further growth in herd numbers, a goal that is totally incompatible with climate policy.  If current projections for the sector are realised in terms of animal numbers and milk and beef output, there will be an inevitable increase in absolute greenhouse gas emissions, regardless of whether on-farm efficiencies are implemented. On-farm efficiency measures do not in themselves reduce total climate impacts.  Total ab­ solute emissions of greenhouse gases and nitrate-ammonia impacts must be reduced, which is almost impossible to envisage without a reduction in livestock numbers.  However, reliance on the uptake of voluntary efficiency measures that were drawn up by Teagasc and in the more recent Ag Climatise roadmap, which was published by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the end of 2020, fails to adequately address the underlying drivers of emissions: cattle numbers and nitrogen inputs in the form of fertilisers and animal feed.  The Ag Climatise roadmap is not consistent with the programme for Government commitment to reduce emis­ sions by on average 7% per annum or 51% by 2030, as the strategy assumes a stabilisation as opposed to an absolute reduction of methane emissions by 2030. Climate action policies for the agricultural sector have to date been based on assumptions about farmers’ responses to theoretical cost savings from voluntary mitigation and efficiency measures, as promoted by Teagasc.  However, even if fully implemented, these measures will not address the multiple environmental impacts of the sector, nor can they be scaled up quickly enough to deliver the required emissions reductions in a timely fashion.  This approach does not consider the effect of policies to expand agricultural output or consider rebound and inter­ action effects, and is thus somewhat skewed towards business as usual.  Without an overarch­ ing mitigation policy, measures are merely cost savings for farming that rebound to increase emissions, as we have seen over the past decade.  Moreover, the focus on cost efficiency falsely assumes that if farms are efficient in the sense of maximising outputs per unit of input in the form of feed and fertiliser, they are environmentally sustainable.  In fact, the only important measure of climate and air pollution action is absolute, instead of relative, annual emissions as reported in the national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions that is published annually by the EPA.  Therefore, efficiency measures in the absence of legally binding targets or a cap are a distraction.  Agricultural emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and ammonia have been increas­ ing steadily since 2011 due to dairy expansion and greatly increased nitrogen inputs, with only a minimal reduction in beef cattle numbers. Requiring herd reductions from beef farmers will not by itself address the water and biodi­ versity impacts from the dairy sector that we highlighted in our report, jointly published with the environmental pillar and the Sustainable Water Network, SWAN.  We concluded that these reductions could even lead to rebound effects as more land becomes available for silage pro­ duction for dairy cows.  The Climate Change Advisory Council undertook a special review of agriculture, forestry and land use in 2019, but assumed in its scenarios that no herd reductions would take place in the dairy sector.  Thus it ignored the growing ecological burden of intensive dairy farming in many areas of the country.  Farmers must be supported with policies that pro­ vide both stable incomes through diversification and that facilitate reduced stocking rates with decreased inputs. Without substantial and sustained reductions in agricultural methane over the next decade, it will not be possible to meet current national and EU climate targets.  It is not expected that agricultural emissions should fall as fast as emissions in other sectors of the economy over the next decade.  It is expected, however, that there must be substantial year-on-year reductions in absolute emissions from agriculture.  For the Government to allow one economic sector in society, a sector that represents one third of Ireland’s emissions, to simply continue business as usual and to insist that the rest of the economy reduce its emissions by two thirds to achieve the overall target for 2030 is highly unfair and impractical.  Dr. Paul Deane of University Col­ lege Cork, UCC, has estimated that if agriculture only achieved 10% emissions reductions, the buildings, energy and transport sectors would have to do more than 70%.  Steadily and perma­ nently reducing agricultural methane in the near term, with annual reductions in the order of 3% to 5% from 2022 to 2030, will be necessary to limit overshoot of Ireland’s national “fair share” of the remaining global carbon budget that is aligned with meeting the Paris Agreement commitments. Policies that support carbon sequestration, although highly important for carbon storage in trees, soils, hedgerows and wetlands, are neither reliable nor permanent methods to offset greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture or fossil fuel combustion.  Furthermore, biomethane production at a large scale involves risks, uncertainties and high costs. Changing the types and quantities of foods we consume could also have a significant im­ pact on emission reductions.  Shifting diets in line with health recommendations would have the positive benefit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and freeing up land for other uses. However, it needs to be acknowledged that while there is potential for emissions reductions from a shift towards plant-based diets among Irish consumers, a reduction in the consumption of animal-sourced food in Ireland is unlikely to have a significant impact on Ireland’s total agri­ cultural greenhouse gas emissions.  This is because most agricultural commodities are produced for export markets.  For this reason, the Government, in its approach to agriculture and food production, must address the total impacts of all food production in Ireland on a territorial basis regardless of where the food is eventually consumed. We have a series of recommendations in our report and I will highlight a few of them here for the committee.  The first is that we recommend that the Government needs to publish a revised roadmap for agricultural emissions reductions that sets out a timescale to achieve, at a minimum, compliance with EU and national law.  We recommend that the Government put in place a declining cap on total national reactive nitrogen and phosphorus usage; consult with stakeholders and implement measures based on international best practice to limit and reverse recent expansion in the dairy sector to bring sectoral greenhouse gas emissions back to 2011 levels by 2025 or as soon as feasible thereafter, with immediate priority given to farms in sensi­ tive catchment areas; and put in place compensatory measures to facilitate and incentivise herd reductions and diversification in the beef suckler and finishing sectors. I thank the committee for the invitation and look forward to taking any questions.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank Senator Higgins, who has asked about the nitrates directive and what would be required of us later if we do not take action immediately.  On the nitrates di­ rective, I refer the Senator to the section in the joint report by the Environmental Pillar, SWAN and Stop Climate Chaos in which we address the multiple drivers and threats to the environ­ ment that emanate from the agricultural sector.  We have a whole section devoted to the issue of water quality. If abandoning the derogation will bring us closer to achieving the objectives of the water framework directive, that is what should be done but it should be a decision taken quite care­ fully.  My understanding, and I am not an expert in water quality, is that derogation farms are, in some sense, more closely supervised than non-derogation farms.  There would be some ben­ efit to the current system if it delivered improvements in water quality.  Unfortunately, as we have seen from EPA reports, this is not happening due to a variety of factors.  We can see from the water quality data that the concentration of water pollution and deteriorating water quality happens in those areas where more intensive dairy farming takes place.  I suggest the Senator makes enquiries of SWAN and the EPA on what the best approach is on the derogation.  What is most important is that we achieve the objectives of the water framework directive, which is to improve all water body qualities and to achieve good water quality status in all of them.  The trends in Ireland are the reverse, unfortunately. With regard to the question of stringent reductions, Deputy Alan Farrell, or perhaps it was Professor Matthews, mentioned New Zealand.  It is interesting to note the Climate Change Commission in New Zealand has just published its report to the government there, setting out its proposed carbon budgets for three periods until 2035, not unlike the periods the climate Bill in Ireland is considering.  What it suggests is that methane emissions need to be reduced quite urgently, by 8% by 2025 and by 17% by 2035.  It is interesting the focus is on near-term ac­ tion because it recognised exactly this point and the cooling effect of methane reductions.  It also acknowledged that it foresees a reduction in agricultural production - it has come out with this quite explicitly - and that there might need to be a reduction of dairy cattle in particular by 8% by 2030.  If we are using New Zealand as an example of a country similar to Ireland with a similar emissions profile and similar pressures, we need to be heading in a direction that is similar to this.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank the Deputy for her interesting questions on the narrative.  She is hitting on something very important.  In other countries where more research has been carried out into alternative scenarios and narratives, some interesting findings have been published. For example, there is a well-known report produced in the UK by the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales called Zero Carbon Britain, which has been updated since its first publica­ tion.  This report maps out exactly what zero emissions for the UK would look like and uses that as a backcasting tool to work out what the implications are for land use.  Unsurprisingly, the report found that there needs to be a shift away from livestock production, which implies a con­ comitant shift towards, in the main, more plant-based diets.  I refer to diets that do not exclude meat entirely but which are plant-based.  More land would also be devoted to the production of food for humans rather than the production of feed for agricultural livestock.  Unfortunately, we do not have a similar mapping exercise available to us in Ireland which we could present to the public or to farmers to show what zero carbon looks like.  Instead, the public has been confused by different numbers, metrics and ways of describing intensity and the impact of food.  The reality is that 91% of our dairy and beef produce is exported.  There is no sense in which Irish people feel connected to the agricultural landscape in the same way that existed in the past.  It is quite detached from local food consumption.  Consequently, having that national conversa­ tion is extremely important.  That is where we get to sit down and talk about food production in terms of consumers, rural communities, the variety of livelihoods that depend on farming, land management and the future of farming so farm viability is guaranteed into the future, which was exactly the Deputy’s point. Other countries in Europe, to a certain extent, have started to outsource their dairy and beef production to countries like Ireland that, on the one hand, can perhaps claim to be doing it more efficiently, according to certain metrics, but at the same time, that means the countries in ques­ tion can regulate their agricultural emissions more easily.  The question for Ireland is, do we want to bear that pollution burden on behalf of countries that are consuming our products?  The Irish public has not been given an opportunity to answer that question. The Deputy’s second question, which was also very interesting and relevant, was about how to support farmers with diversification and whether there is enough courage in the system to take the measures necessary.  The Deputy is hitting exactly on a core issue, which is that the farm advisory services and research services provided by Teagasc have been skewed in favour of what we call the business as usual, the livestock model and increasing production efficiency, as Professor Matthews said.  It is very influenced by the interests of the dairy and beef industries and, unfortunately, there has been much less attention and effort put into diversification in re­ spect of research or working with the many farmers who are actually engaged in these practices. They feel very detached from Teagasc, do not feel supported and do not feel the research is supporting their efforts to manage their land according to agroecological or regenerative farm­ ing principles.  The few agencies and research centres engaged in that kind of thing are tiny in comparison to where they should be. We should be world leaders in regenerative agriculture but the courage is lacking.  We need to instigate a review of Teagasc, just as we might review other public bodies from time to time to ensure their mandate, the composition of their boards and the level of expertise available to them are appropriate for the public services those bodies are required to provide.  That includes bringing on board more ecological expertise into the agronomic and agricultural sciences, be­ cause if those disciplines are so detached from each other, it is no wonder we have seen the agricultural pressures on the environment we have experienced.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank Deputy Whitmore for an excellent question.  I will highlight the fact that in 2019, the Climate Change Advisory Council produced a special report on ag­ riculture, which is a really excellent read.  It discusses many of the issues regarding metrics, details and the drivers eloquently, clearly and succinctly.  It identified five key drivers for emis­ sions in Ireland.  It is worth recapping them, namely, an increase in global demand for dairy and beef products; abolition of the milk quota; the agrifood strategies, Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025; beef sector supports such as the beef environmental efficiency programme-suckler, BEEP-S, mechanisms; and target agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, that is, support for capital investment, which has greatly encouraged dairy intensification. If we are going to do anything about mitigation, we need to first of all look at what is driving the problem.  This is clearly the place to start.  We cannot do much about global demand except possibly divesting ourselves of the responsibility of producing food to feed the world, because that is a nonsense.  We should not have to do that.  We should also recognise that, globally speaking, the focus on beef and dairy is driving species to extinction.  It is using far too much land and is not going to support the nutritional needs of a growing world population.  Ireland should not be jumping on this bandwagon in a desire to support our farmers.  We have to pro­ vide an alternative model consistent with meeting the human development needs of a growing population. The milk quota was a major driver in Ireland but, unlike other EU countries, we used it as an opportunity to expand dairy production.  We did not need to do that because the trends were moving in a positive direction prior to this and emissions from agriculture were coming down steadily until 2011, when they started to increase again.  The first port of call is to make sure that any future agrifood strategy, and comments for a current draft of a strategic environmental assessment are closing today, has to be consistent with meeting our climate and biodiversity obligations by 2030.  If we pass or adopt another agrifood strategy that even suggests a modest decrease in methane emissions, we will be failing.  That is a failure.  It is a recipe for disaster and we will be asking ourselves again in five years’ time, how did it happen and how did it come about that agricultural emissions are going up? If we want to communicate to farmers what a just transition looks like, the first thing we need to do is get our house in order on the policy side.  We need to provide an articulated, clear, policy framework that is consistent between the Department of the Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the climate action agenda.  The regulatory context in which that is going to unfold, if the climate Bill is passed, will be extremely tight.  There will be consequences if emissions targets are not met.  We need to have a look at those supports, whether they are fossil fuel sub­ sidies or any form of subsidy that is giving the wrong incentive, whether in the beef sector or in dairy capital investment programmes.  They need to be looked at again.  We need to stop incentivising the bad and to start incentivising the good, including eco-schemes and providing additional supports where that is appropriate. We need to do something on the market side, because if food prices do not reflect the en­ vironmental costs, we are on a hiding to nothing and farmers will wonder why they are being asked to do something that is completely uneconomic.  We need to address the bigger picture of market failure.  The role of intermediaries, like supermarkets, is critically important in Ireland because supermarkets and wholesalers have a very strong level of control over the standards of food production from their suppliers.  I do not know if that adequately addresses the Deputy’s question, but if there if any further detail I will be happy to provide it.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome Dr. O’Mara and Professor Boyle.  Indeed, I extend the good wishes that my colleagues have sent to Professor Boyle and I wish him well in the next few months before he finishes up.  I thank him for his work with Teagasc over the years. Professors O’Mara and Boyle have acknowledged the beef versus dairy situation.  It seems that until the 2010s our emissions were reducing, largely because the suckler herd was reduc­ ing and then it turned around.  Now we have a situation wherein any gains that we have made through the reduction in the suckler herd have been unfortunately negatively offset by the in­ crease in the dairy herd.  Had that reduction continued, we would be at something like 15 mega­ tonnes of agricultural emissions per year instead of 21 or so.  The professors have acknowl­ edged that and it is a most significant point on which we should probably dwell more - perhaps not in this session but in further sessions. The professors have mentioned an EU study which shows Irish milk to have the joint lowest carbon footprint in the EU.  Bear in mind 90% of our milk product is exported.  Does the study include the carbon footprint as a result of export? The same section in the statement refers to the international context.  The United Nations understands the biggest threat to global food security is climate change.  Many of our develop­ ment agencies such as Trócaire and Concern are working with some of the poorest communities around the world which suffer extreme hardship and famine as a result of climate-related floods, droughts, water scarcity and food insecurity. More than one quarter of the world’s population, approximately 2 billion people, do not have regular access to nutritious and sufficient food and the Covid-19 pandemic only makes matters worse.  The painful irony is industrial agricultural systems with high greenhouse gas emissions, such as we have in Ireland, contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss.  We must get our house in order.  The best thing we could do to prevent increases in global hunger and malnutrition and to avoid future breakdowns in food and livelihood systems is to ensure our agrifood policy and processing of food do not contribute further to climate change. On the issue of biogenic methane, action 4 states that “Biogenic methane such as methane from ruminant livestock is different from other greenhouse gases because of its biological ori­ gin and its relatively short life span in the atmosphere.”  That statement is quite misleading. Biogenic methane and methane are the same molecule, as the witnesses are aware.  They are the same thing and have the same effect in terms of global warming potential, irrespective of their source.  The biogenic refers to the source.  It is misleading because it implies this methane has a different effect on global warming potential when it does not.  It does not have a shorter lifes­ pan than fossil-derived methane in the atmosphere, regardless of whether its source is biogenic. Methane, whatever its source, needs to be reduced drastically if we are to tackle climate change. The point below that on the Teagasc submission refers to the GWP100 and the GWP* sys­ tems of accounting but GWP10 and GWP20 were not mentioned.  If GWP10 and GWP20 had been mentioned, one would have stated methane had a global warming potential of 88 times the warming effect with those systems as with GWP100.  It is short-lived compared with carbon dioxide but converts to carbon dioxide after it breaks down.  It is a potent greenhouse gas and is not, by any means, an insignificant one.  No matter what system we use, we cannot get away from that. I ask the witnesses to give us more information on the most important line in the statement, that reducing methane “can be associated with a cooling effect”.  That is critical.  On the issue of biogenic methane, the statement notes that “the CO2 produced is effectively new carbon re­ leased from permanent carbon stores and therefore must be treated differently because it inputs additional CO2 into the atmosphere”.  The reality, however, is that increasing herd numbers inputs additional CO2 into the atmosphere also.  I think there is a sleight of hand here.  This line gives the impression that methane that comes from ruminants is somewhat less harmful than fossil-derived methane, and that, scientifically, is not correct.  Teagasc goes on, on the last page of its submission: “Because of the significant difference between biogenic methane and fossil fuel derived CO2, scientists propose setting a separate target for biogenic methane in climate targets.”  That is the subject of debate, but I do not believe - and the witnesses may correct me if they know more about this - that the IPCC or the United Nations have proposed any change in how we account for biogenic methane. I will ask the witnesses some questions.  I know we do not have much time, but if they would like to revert in writing, I would appreciate that.  Can they tell me how much the beef and dairy herd have grown in numbers in the past five to ten years and what the increase in nitrogen fertiliser has been over that time?  That, of course, is a very significant greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of, I think, over 200 times that of CO2.  In Teagasc’s 2020-27 sectoral roadmap, it shows projected increases in cattle numbers from 1.4 million to 1.65 mil­ lion and increasing output from the dairy sector.  Could the witnesses give us an indication of the expected overall emissions increase from the beef and dairy sector attributed to 2027, not on an efficiency-per-cow basis but from an absolute emissions point of view?  I do not expect them to have these numbers right now, but if they could revert, I would appreciate that. As for the issue of hedgerows, the document Teagasc sent us refers to sequestration from hedgerows, and we know hedgerows are excellent for biodiversity and should be promoted.  I wonder how impactful they are from a carbon sequestration point of view.  Perhaps the wit­ nesses could estimate the numbers quoted in their note to us to give us the national picture. How much hedgerow coverage have we got in Ireland, and what is the suggested coverage of hedgerows over the next few years?  I think Dr. O’Mara said we have 650,000 km of hedgerow, but how does that translate into an acreage basis?  I think it was Dr. O’Mara who mentioned that 50% of methane emissions can be offset by sequestration on the average suckler farm.  Is that a temporary or a permanent sequestration?  How is it verified, and is there a scientific basis that is aligned with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA’s, methods for compiling its emissions inventory?",

  "Exact Text": "I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to provide evidence on the issues arising from the role of methane in climate policy design.  I am a professor in the faculty of engineering and computing, DCU and research climate mitigation policy.  I am ac­ companied remotely at today’s session by my colleague, Mr. Paul Price, who currently holds a research fellowship at DCU that was awarded by the Climate Change Advisory Council of Ireland. We are here as independent academic researchers and do not speak on behalf of either DCU or the Climate Change Advisory Council.  In the interest of time, I will shorten my remarks a little but my full statement is available to the committee. We see the following points as key to ongoing assessment of the role of methane emissions in Irish climate policy.  Ireland is a voluntary party to the Paris Agreement.  This specifically in­ cludes the commitment to quantitative limits on global temperature rise.  In Ireland’s case, this has been transposed into domestic legislation through the Climate Action and Low Carbon De­ velopment (Amendment) Act 2021.  The Act established a statutory national “carbon budget” framework and requires this to be implemented in a manner consistent with Ireland’s equitable obligations under the Paris Agreement. First and foremost, Ireland’s carbon budgets must be designed and assessed by whether they represent an equitable contribution to meeting the Paris temperature rise goals.  In the light of the rapidly destabilising global climate conditions, of which we are all aware, and the recent In­ tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5oC, this is now understood to mean limiting global temperature rise to 1.5oC over pre-industrial levels with absolutely minimal overshoot of that level in either the amount of temperature rise or the duration of the overshoot. The global scenarios assessed in the most recent IPCC assessment report 6 are unequivo­ cal that meeting this temperature rise commitment requires rapid and deep cuts in the global emissions of all three of the most significant greenhouse gases that arise from human activities, which are: CO2, nitrous oxide and methane. As members will have heard in the earlier session, there are technical and scientific issues that arise in assessing the temperature impacts from these different gases, particularly when they are combined into a single aggregate carbon budget for policy purposes, as under the Irish Act.  The de facto approach to this uses a method referred to as the global warming potential over 100 years, or GWP100.  The first Irish carbon budget programme has been expressed with this de facto method.  However, it is widely recognised and well understood that this particular method, if used in isolation, may give a poor representation of the trade-offs in warming impact that are associated with the physical characteristics of the different gases.  Of the three main greenhouse gases, this particularly affects methane.  Indeed, this appears to be recognised in the Act, which requires appropriate consideration of the “distinctive” characteristics of methane. Unfortunately, the text of the Act qualified this further by referring to “biogenic” methane, which serves rather to obscure than to clarify.  While there is a significant distinction in warm­ ing impact of methane versus the other gases, there is only a very minor and, effectively, imma­ terial distinction in warming impact between methane from biogenic versus non-biogenic fossil sources.  That is true over the period of decades, say, 50 years ahead, that we are most acutely concerned with because that is when we have to limit and peak global temperature rise.  This has led to some unnecessary confusion in the interpretation of the Act’s provisions. Nonetheless, it is very important to state that in developing the recommendations for the first carbon budget programme the Climate Change Advisory Council explicitly took account of these provisions in the Act.  The council analysed the limitations of GWP100 aggregation in respect of how a mixed-gas budget relates to temperature impact.  This work has been done. The council showed that with any fixed GWP100 budget that the temperature impact will vary significantly depending on exactly how that budget is distributed across the different gases. It presented a number of scenarios for this distribution.  The council showed that those with relatively smaller budget allocations for methane, which is deeper reductions in methane, cor­ respond directly to lower aggregate temperature impacts. Separate work at DCU has investigated the warming impact of a wide variety of multi-gas greenhouse gas budget scenarios.  We have used the method called GWP*, which was origi­ nally developed at the University of Oxford by Professor Myles Allen, from whom the commit­ tee has heard evidence this morning.  To our knowledge, this was the first application of GWP* to examine multi-gas GHG budgets at a national level.  In our most recent analysis we showed that there is a clear trade-off in Irish climate policy between the degree of reduction in annual emissions of methane and a tacit commitment to future, large scale net removals of CO2.  So the more reduction we make in ongoing emissions of methane then the less commitment we are making to removing CO2 from the future and the less of an “I owe you” or IOU that we place on our young people today to remove CO2 in the future. Based on particular criteria for alignment with the Paris Agreement temperature goals, and physical constraints on CO2 removal in Ireland, we estimate that the annual mass emissions of methane in Ireland would need to fall by about 50% by 2050, relative to 2018 levels, on the basis of an equitable contribution to meeting the temperature goals for Ireland. The faster this reduction in methane is achieved then the lower the risk of overshoot of the Irish contribution to global temperature rise.  Please note that this still requires aggregate mass emissions of CO2 and nitrous oxide to be reduced by more than 100%, so methane by 50% and the aggregate of nitrous oxide and CO2 needs to be reduced by more than 100%, which is to go negative as emphasised by Professor Allen. Some commentary on the distinctive characteristics of methane in general, and the GWP* methodology in particular, has suggested that it would be sufficient for Irish climate goals if annual mass emissions of methane were initially stabilised and then declined at a very slow rate of 3% per decade or 0.3% per annum. Unfortunately, this suggestion is based on a mislead­ ing conflation of climate stabilisation with meeting the temperature rise constraint.  These are complementary but quite separate goals.  While stabilisation is necessary but it is not sufficient in itself.  We must stabilise at a temperature where meaningful and managed climate adapta­ tion is still possible.  We are seeing visibly how difficult that already is at the current level of temperature rise.  This temperature limit is the overriding goal but to achieve same then it is absolutely essential that mass emissions of methane fall rapidly, and substantially, though not quite as fast or as deep as CO2 and nitrous oxide.  This is true globally and especially true for Ireland because of its unusually large per capita emissions of methane.  While improvements in methodology, metrics and calculation can help to refine the quantitative assessment of the required level of reduction, they do not alter the underlying physics. In the specific case of Ireland, methane emissions are dominated by ruminant agriculture. The relationship with cattle numbers is complex but scales very directly with total output, which is litres of milk and kilos of beef.  This has been clearly apparent during the recent rapid and policy-led expansion in dairy production.  Previous evidence to this committee from Mr. Price has addressed this in more detail and will not be repeated here.  We would simply empha­ sise that we sympathise greatly with the committee in confronting the distinctive and systemic challenges now facing this sector in Ireland.  We would not seek in any way to downplay the difficulties involved.  However, we emphasise that, as has been manifest in recent extreme weather events on a global basis, the physical climate system is, unfortunately, entirely indif­ ferent to these difficulties.  It will not respond to our aspirations but only to our actions and specifically to our ongoing emissions of greenhouse gases. We look forward to addressing any questions that committee members may have.",

  "Year": 2022,
  "Sliding_year": "2022-2024",
  "Speaker": "Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Charlie McConalogue)",
  "Exact Text": "I wel­ come the opportunity to present the Revised Estimates for 2022 to the committee.  Budget 2022 was set with the ongoing challenges of Brexit and Covid in the background and in the transi­ tion between the current Common Agricultural Policy and the new CAP.  The agriculture Vote for 2022 provides my Department with the resources to deal with these current challenges and opportunities across the various sectors in agriculture, food development, marine and forestry. My sole focus as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the protection and en­ hancement of the incomes of those who are the bedrock of the sector, namely, farmers, fishers and food producers and their families.  In a time of transition, farmers can have confidence that the budget protected farm family income and supported action to improve safety and sustain­ ability on farms.  We succeeded in protecting all the crucial farm schemes and the budget provi­ sion allowed us to provide additional funding for a number of policy priorities. The resilience of the sector is demonstrated by the fact that exports of agrifood products in 2021 are estimated to be around €15.2 billion, an increase of almost €1 billion or 7% on the 2020 figure of €14.2 billion and a 70% increase on the €8.9 billion recorded in 2010.  These figures include €1.7 billion in non-edible agrifood sector goods, including forestry and animal feedstuffs, which are not included in the Bord Bia food and drink figure of €13.5 billion.  My Department and its agencies, in consultation with stakeholders, continues to monitor the im­ pacts on the agrifood sector as the situation evolves, and to provide appropriate supports to the sector coming out of Brexit. For 2022, the total Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounts to €1.891 billion.  That is comprised of €1.574 billion in current expenditure and €317 million in capital expenditure.  This figure represents a gross increase of approximately 4% or €65 million on the 2021 allocation and builds on the 11% increase on the allocation I secured in budget 2021. It is anticipated that the Department will receive further funding from the Brexit adjustment reserve during 2022 through Supplementary Estimates, thereby giving the committee an oppor­ tunity to examine the proposals at that stage too.  We are working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard. When appropriations-in-aid are considered, the 2022 net Vote is estimated at €1.461 billion. This is arrived at by deducting the income we receive in appropriations-in-aid from our overall expenditure.  The agriculture Vote is subdivided into four expenditure programmes correspond­ ing to the four key strategic objectives set out in the current statement of strategy.  I will now speak about each of these four programmes, A to D, and the key themes. Programme A relates to food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare.  The total allocation for programme A in 2022 was €341 million, an increase of 6%.  Irish farmers, fish­ ers and agrifood companies produce world-class food that is known across the world.  They produce products to the highest international standards of food safety and quality.  Our food safety and traceability systems continue to be recognised as among the very best in the world. Regarding programme expenditure, I am continuing to fund vital services to ensure those stan­ dards are maintained, including the meat inspection service and the various supports provided by the Department testing laboratories. The level of bovine tuberculosis in Ireland continues to be relatively low with progress be­ ing made during 2021 thanks to the new TB strategy I launched at the end of 2020.  TB levels are lower than in the previous year for the first time since 2016.  Enhanced actions to clear in­ fection from herds experiencing extended breakdowns were initiated in June 2021.  The goal is to eliminate TB infection from such herds to help them go clear as soon as possible and reduce the risk of repeat breakdowns.  The TB forum, supported by Department officials, will continue, during 2022 and beyond, to implement the policy options outlined in the bovine TB eradication strategy.  Our focus will be set on reducing disease year by year.  The strategy is not set in stone. It is very much a roadmap and will be subject to revision on an ongoing basis in line with the trajectory of the disease.  I have increased funding in the wildlife programme to help to further drive down TB rates this year and beyond.  I have discussed with members the importance of this matter at meetings of the committee over the past year. The programme for Government committed to a doubling of the ex gratia funding for ani­ mal welfare organisations within two years.  Funding has been provided in 2022 to fulfil this commitment.  Funding in programme A will also support the wind-down of fur farming opera­ tions in the State.  I will be progressing Report Stage of that legislation in the Dáil later this evening. Programme B relates to farm sector supports and controls.  It is where the vast majority of our farm schemes are housed.  A total of just over €939 million is available to programme B in 2022, to be paid almost exclusively to farm families.  That is in addition to €1.2 billion funding from the European Union in respect of the various direct payment schemes. Keeping farmers farming and assisting them in producing the world-class, safe and sustain­ able food they do is a key priority of mine.  This support is also vital to farmers who deliver public goods and environmental benefits.  As well as the inherent environmental benefits in­ volved, this investment enhances our sustainability credentials, which are invaluable as we serve increasingly demanding and knowledgeable customers at home and around the world. There are several key provisions in programme B in my Department’s Estimate for 2022. Conscious of the pressures on the tillage sector, I will allocate some €15 million of this sum specifically for that sector.  This is an increase of €5 million on the outgoing year. Beef and sheep farming is the lifeblood of many rural communities and helps ensure a bal­ anced regional economy.  The 2022 Estimate provides €104 million in targeted supports for livestock farming.  I am providing more than €85 million to support sustainable beef farming. This includes over €40 million for the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, during the transition period.  It also includes over €44 million for the beef sector efficiency pilot, based on the BEEP-S scheme. The sheep welfare scheme provides a valuable support to sheep farmers for undertaking actions which make a positive contribution to flock welfare.  I was pleased to be able to secure additional funding for the scheme in budget 2022.  This underlines my commitment to the sheep sector.  The allocation for sheep welfare scheme has increased from its original allocation of €17 million in 2021 to €19.5 million in 2022 to cover the continuation of the scheme in 2022 and the change of reference year, leading to an increased number of sheep being able to avail of the scheme. These measures, together with the allocation of more than €450 million for schemes such as the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the results-based environment agri pilot, REAP, and areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme will support livestock farmers to improve the economic and environmental performance of their herds while providing valuable income support for the sector.  I am also providing €79 million, made up of €50.287 million in subhead B5, which includes a €29.9 million carryover, as well as €29 million in European Union recovery instrument, EURI, funding, including the capital carryover, for targeted agri­ culture modernisation schemes, TAMS, to support investment on farms and the continuation of the TAMS during the transitional period. Turning to forestry, which I know is a priority of this committee, I am providing €100 mil­ lion in support of the forestry sector.  This provision is in recognition of the vital contribution it can make in mitigating climate change and supplementing farm incomes.  In 2022, our aim is to increase the number of afforestation licences we issue.  The overall output of licences increased by almost 60% from a low base in 2020.  This demonstrates significant progress and we are determined to see that trajectory continue through this year. Supplies of timber for the processing sector have thankfully stabilised over 2021.  This time last year we were in a real crisis with supply.  The backlog of forestry licence appeals, which had been a significant administrative burden and a delaying factor in many licence applications, is being dealt with, piece by piece and bit by bit, making progress each week and month. In addition, an independent regulatory review of the forestry licensing system has been commissioned, a new system facilitating a pre-application engagement between the forester and the Department is being piloted and arrangements are being made to provide a financial contribution to applicants towards the cost of environmental reports.  We will also publish a new forestry strategy for Ireland this year. The carbon tax allocation has been reduced from €23 million in 2021 to €3 million for 2022. The programme for Government commitment provides for additional current funding of €1.5 billion of carbon tax funding for new schemes that will incentivise farmers to farm in a green and more sustainable way up to 2030.  This funding will be additional to that provided for by the Common Agricultural Policy.  This commitment is being met in full.  It is intended to pro­ gramme the carbon tax funding to enhance the new schemes proposed under the CAP strategic plan. In the programme for Government the clear commitment was to direct the additional carbon tax funding specifically towards enhancing the environmental scheme in the CAP.  Because the new CAP was delayed by two years and will not start until January 2023, I have reduced the profile of the carbon tax in 2022.  The funding will be available to be pumped into the environ­ mental scheme between 2023 and 2027.  This is being true to the programme for Government commitment on expenditure of the carbon tax.  This will allow funding to be programmed into the CAP strategic plan, ensuring compliance with agriculture state-aid rules and with a view to securing Commission approval for the interventions proposed in the CAP strategic plan.  We will see a coherent green architecture in CAP strategic plan that will run from 2023 to 2027. Programme C deals with policy and strategy.  The total allocation for programme C is al­ most €403 million.  Many of the programme C allocations reflect the comprehensive approach to Brexit responsiveness.  Access to finance is crucial for business needs and is a key part of the Government’s response to the challenges posed by Brexit.  In addition to liaising with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector, my Department and I work closely with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department, as well as with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and his Department.  The Estimates for 2022 will provide for ongoing access to the loan schemes through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland for farmers, fishers and food and drink SMEs. To support our food industry a provision of €7 million has been made for this year through the Enterprise Ireland capital investment scheme.  This is to support the meat and dairy sectors investing in greater product and market diversification.  We will support Irish research and in­ novation activity to enable the sector to innovate and deliver greater efficiency and economic, environmental and social sustainability. In 2022, for the first time, there is a dedicated budget for farm safety of €2 million.  I recog­ nise the ongoing work of the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, in making real progress in this area.  This new funding will play a significant role in achieving cultural change around safety on our farms.  They are working environments and we must continue to work together to make them safer.  Reductions in the rate of fatal and serious incidents on farms will happen only by changing behaviours, increasing awareness, training, and investment in key farm safety and in farmer mental health and well-being measures.  The €2 million allocation is in addition to the continued funding for farm safety equipment under TAMS, a recently launched accelerated capital allowances for farm safety equipment scheme, and a range of locally-led schemes fo­ cused on farm health, safety, and well-being projects. In recent budgets increased funding has been provided to Bord Bia to strengthen its under­ standing of consumer priorities and preferences in Ireland and in distant markets and to com­ municate these insights to Irish food companies for use in product promotion, development, branding and marketing.  The Bord Bia grant is €53 million in the 2022 Estimate. Teagasc’s capital allocation has been increased by €3.85 million to €10.45 million.  With this funding Teagasc proposes to establish the national agricultural sustainability research and innovation centre at Johnstown Castle.  This is a strategically important project to support stra­ tegic national commitments to increase the sustainability of our agricultural and food systems. The project has been in gestation for some time due to funding requirements.  I was pleased to secure €9 million in Exchequer grant aid towards the construction costs from the Department’s capital budget on a phased basis to 2024.  The allocation this year is €3 million.  This funding represents a strong commitment by the Government to provide farmers and other stakehold­ ers with access to practical solutions to improve soil health, restore and protect biodiversity, improve water quality, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and ammonia, and enhance soil carbon sequestration. I was very glad to be able to visit Johnstown Castle prior to Christmas to turn the sod on the new research and innovation centre and officially open the newly revamped Johnstown Castle. It is now opened to the public.  It was my first time there and anyone in the area should visit it. It is a tremendous castle that has been well restored.  It is well worth a visit.  It is on the same grounds as the existing facilities and the new national agricultural sustainability research and innovation centre.  Johnstown Castle is where much of the research was done to verify the emis­ sions reduction potential of low-emission slurry spreading, which enabled us to programme the gains we are getting from it into our national inventory to reduce our overall emissions.  It is a real-life example of the work that has been going on there.  The new innovation centre will help to drive this forward and will be very important in the coming decade. The allocation to the horse and greyhound racing fund is €89.7 million.  This is a reduction of €7.8 million when compared with last year’s allocation.  As we welcome back spectators to both sports the fund’s 2022 budget allocation is appropriate. Programme D deals with the seafood sector.  The provision for the Department’s seafood programme has been increased by 17% to a total of €207 million for the continued promotion of the environmentally sustainable development of our fisheries sector, aquaculture and wider seafood industry.  This sector supports some 16,000 direct and indirect jobs almost exclusively in coastal communities.  The provision will help fund vital investment in our fishery harbours, most particularly in Killybegs, Howth and Castletownbere.  I also announced significant invest­ ment of €25 million for a new deep water harbour in Rossaveel. The budget allocation for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, in 2022 will al­ low it to continue to meet its national and EU obligations as Ireland’s competent authority for the enforcement of sea fisheries and seafood safety law, and to meet challenges coming from Brexit.  The core areas of the SFPA include the costs associated with certifying seafood in food business premises throughout the country and providing 24-7 inspection services at the main fishery harbour centres and numerous secondary ports around the coast. In response to the impacts of the trade and co-operation agreement I established a seafood task force in March 2021 to examine these impacts and make recommendations on appropriate measures to mitigate them.  The Navigating Change report of the seafood task force recom­ mends 16 support schemes with an estimated cost of €423 million to assist the seafood sector and coastal communities to mitigate the impacts of the trade and co-operation agreement, in­ cluding temporary and permanent cessation schemes for the fishing sector, capital investment schemes for seafood processing and aquaculture, marketing supports, marine infrastructure re­ newal, enhanced community-led local development through the seven fisheries local action groups, and liquidity support for co-operatives and processors. Most of the schemes recommended by the task force are proposed to be funded in 2022 and 2023 under the EU Brexit adjustment reserve.  An amount of €31.5 million has been allocated to Bord Iascaigh Mhara in this year’s Estimate to manage schemes that are approved under the Brexit adjustment reserve along with its other normal important work.  The recommendations of the task force are being urgently examined and assessed across government with regard to available funds, eligibility under the Brexit adjustment reserve, state aid and the public spend­ ing code.  A Brexit temporary fleet tie-up scheme recommended by the task force was imple­ mented in 2021 and provided supports to vessels in the polyvalent and beam trawl segments to temporarily cease fishing activity in a particular calendar month, thus increasing the quota available for remaining vessels that were fishing.  The scheme had a total of 229 applicants of which 179 were successful.  The cost of the scheme was approximately €10 million.  The task force has recommended a second temporary fleet tie-up scheme for 2022 and I am considering that. In January I announced a Brexit inshore fisheries business model adjustment scheme to pro­ vide support to assist inshore fishers in adjusting their business model to the post-Brexit market environment.  As recommended by the task force, one-off payments of €2,700 are available to owners of vessels under 8 m in length and €4,000 for owners of vessels between 8 m and 18 m in length.  That scheme has a total budget of €3.7 million.  The Brexit adjustment reserve funding is an initial allocation for 2022 and I will be announcing other schemes in the coming weeks and months.  These will be rolled out on a phased and prioritised basis as recommended by the task force. This is a comprehensive, if not especially brief, overview of some of the key issues and the range of measures that apply in the agrifood and marine sectors for this year.  I am satisfied that the 2022 allocation, together with the supports to be provided under the Brexit adjustment reserve, will provide a good, balanced package of measures for farmers, fishers, coastal com­ munities and the food sector.  I look forward to taking questions on specific areas and further developing some of the key points on which I have given an overview.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank the Cathaoirleach and members for the invitation to discuss the agriculture contribution to Climate Action Plan 2023.  I am joined in the room by Mr. Bill Callanan, chief inspector at the Department, Ms Edwina Love, head of climate, and Mr. Liam Brennan, inspector of cli­ mate.  We are joined online by Mr. Fergus Moore, senior inspector in forestry, and Mr. Philip Blackwell, agricultural senior inspector in land use. At the outset, I wish to state my commitment and that of the agriculture sector to making the fullest contribution possible to achieving our national climate ambitions.  Our great sec­ tor, which is the backbone of rural Ireland and ensures a balanced regional economy, is fully subscribed and committed to meeting our ambitious targets.  The 51% cut in greenhouse gas emissions for Ireland is an economy-wide target and will need each of us, regardless of the sector in which we operate, to play our part.  Agriculture’s journey towards a greater level of sustainability is nothing new.  In reality, our family farms have been at the vanguard of driving positive environmental change for years.  Take for example, the huge level of interest farmers have shown in joining ACRES, our €1.5 million flagship agri-environmental scheme.  We have had some 46,000 farmers apply to join, and just yesterday I was glad to be able to confirm that I have secured places for all of those successful applicants in the scheme. Our farmers have a vested interest in ensuring a positive response to the climate challenge. Farmers and fishers operate at the coalface and see first-hand the impacts of climate change, and especially those extreme weather events.  They are also citizens, and just like the rest of us want to secure a healthy and prosperous environment for their families and their livelihoods. Climate change does not respect sectoral boundaries, and it does not respect industry bound­ aries.  It is the challenge of our generation.  It is a challenge that will only be solved by us all working together as a united force.  The 25% sectoral emission ceiling set for the agricultural sector is a hugely challenging target and one that will see our sector change over the coming decade, but we are determined to get there.  We were the very first sector to have a credible roadmap for achieving our climate ambitions.  Scientific and technological solutions are evolv­ ing all the time as well. In the climate action plan 2023, we have focused our measures on three key themes: first, inputs and additives; second, husbandry practices; and, third, diversification.  In practical terms, the types of measures we are undertaking include reducing chemical nitrogen usage and chang­ ing fertiliser type, providing voluntary diversification options for farmers, while also improv­ ing the environmental dividend from our farmed land.  Each of these measures is supported by a range of actions, setting out a viable pathway towards reaching our target.  They require transformational change.  To put it simply and bluntly, the target for agriculture is anything but business as usual, and will require transformational change. I very recently brought forward legislation which will see the introduction of a national fertiliser database in the coming months.  I would like to touch first on the inputs and additives strand.  This will allow us to collect a range of information on fertiliser products as well as details of fertiliser economic operators and end users.  It will also support farmers in reducing usage and engaging with industry-led sustainability measurement. Nitrogen reduction is also supported through the continuation of aid for low-emission slur­ ry spreading, LESS, equipment.  More than 5,100 applications have been paid in full under the LESS measure of the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS 2, since it was launched in 2015.  That means that we have more than 5,000 low-emission slurry spreaders in the country from that standing start in 2015.  From 2023, I have increased funding from 40% to 60% under the recently-launched new TAMS 3 investment scheme for low-emission slurry spreading machinery. Alongside reducing the chemical fertiliser allowances for farmers, we are encouraging the adoption of protected urea, which will help to achieve ammonia emissions targets in addition to greenhouse gas emission reductions.  These changes can have benefits for the environment as well as profitability at farm level too through a reduction in input costs. To touch on husbandry practices, in 2022, I established the Food Vision 2030 dairy group, and the Food Vision 2030 beef and sheep groups.  Their purpose was to advance the actions for the dairy, beef and sheep sectors identified in the Food Vision 2030 strategy, taking account of the requirement for the sectors to contribute to achieving our climate targets.  This collaborative approach has been critical to securing engagement by the sector in our decarbonisation path­ way.  Both the beef and sheep and the dairy groups have recently submitted their final reports, which have been published.  While the measures put forward have not been agreed by all mem­ bers of the groups, both reports offer potential pathways to reducing emissions, with specific measures identified as well to contribute to that goal. Both groups recognised the contribution that methane-mitigating breeding strategies can play in building carbon efficiency traits into our livestock population.  I am keen to explore how we can, with the necessary commitment of all stakeholders, extend the work we have already done to improve the genetic profile of the herd in recent years.  For example, I like to, and am committed to ensuring that Ireland becomes the first country in the world to genotype all live­ stock in the country.  Farmers have not been afraid of innovation and I think the genotyping space is something, if we can deliver on it, that will be of huge benefit to the entire sector. Reducing the slaughter age of cattle is another key recommendation of the Food Vision 2030 beef and sheep group.  I have taken both these measures forward into the climate action plan.  The new suckler carbon efficiency programme I introduced is designed to specifically improve the environmental sustainability and genetic merit of the suckler herd.  We have an overall allocation in this of €256 million for the next five years. On the third strand of diversification, some of the diversification opportunities that are avail­ able will include, for example, more tillage, anaerobic digestion, organics and forestry.  In tillage, we will exploit the opportunity for import substitution of cereals and proteins, adding to the sustainability of Irish-produced feed.  I have ensured that support is available in the cur­ rent common agricultural policy, CAP, strategic plan through the protein aid scheme with an increase from €3 million to €7 million per annum.  I am also supporting new tillage land con­ version with the tillage incentive scheme and carbon sequestration by the tillage sector through a straw incorporation measure. Delivery of a biomethane industry of scale will be important for agriculture, but also for industry and the decarbonisation of heat supply.  We are currently commissioning consultants to develop a biomethane strategy by quarter 3 of this year.  There is a fivefold increase in funding for organic farming to €256 million to triple the area of land that we currently farm organically to 7.5%. The number of overall farmers farming organically has more than doubled to approximately 4,300.  It is absolutely fair to say that there has been a really significant step change in attitude, culture, approach and appetite to going organic.  We are reflecting that in funding.  Organic farmers are also eligible for support of 60% in the organic capital investment scheme, OCIS, and have priority access to ACRES. TAMS 3 also recently opened, consisting of ten different schemes which will support farm­ ers in this journey too.  An example of key innovation we have is the solar capital investment scheme, which will see the grant rate increased from 40% to 60%, with a €90,000 funding in­ vestment ceiling available to every family farm, separate to other schemes in TAMS.  I believe this is a real opportunity for which, again, there will be a very significant uptake from farmers. Overall, the CAP strategic plan has seen a significant increase in national co-funding, bring­ ing the total to €10 billion, with €1.5 billion included for ACRES.  In addition to the effective deployment of the CAP strategic plan funds, the changes needed will require other levers, in­ cluding regulation, industry and market incentives.  Such messages and incentives from indus­ try will be just as important as Government initiatives. I am going to touch briefly on land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF.  The deci­ sion to temporarily defer the inclusion of LULUCF in the sectoral emissions ceiling process is a good example of recognising when we need to pause and to take stock to enable better decisions to be made in the long run.  It is important that we better understand what is happening with regard to our soils and our forest estate before setting targets as to what we will be achieving. My priority is to ensure that we do not compromise action in this area, and continue to make progress in the meantime.  The commitments made in climate action plan 2023 with respect to reduced management intensity on our soils and also in terms of afforestation are testament to this.  These commitments are supported by my Department’s investment in the establishment of a national agricultural soil carbon observatory by supplying the scientific infrastructure to measure greenhouse gas fluxes from soils under agricultural management.  This includes ap­ proximately 30 greenhouse gas, GHG, flux towers across a range of soil types over the country. Last November as well, we proposed a €1.3 billion investment in Irish forestry over the next five years, with a comprehensive package of measures ensuring that premiums will increase by up to 66%. We cannot achieve our ambitions of climate neutrality without the land use sector making changes over the decades ahead.  To this end, we are also investing in our peat soils under ag­ ricultural management. Change is not easy as all of the members here know, and does not happen overnight either. In addition to financial supports, farmers need to have access to the latest science, and the role of both Teagasc and the private advisory network in this regard cannot be underestimated either. Recently, we launched a nationwide Teagasc signpost farm network to showcase best practice in this regard, and work to showcase the direction of travel to farmers. I want to mention briefly the commitments relating to the marine environment, reflected for the first time in a stand-alone chapter in the climate action plan.   My Department has committed to the delivery of a number of adaptation and mitigation actions which centre on four high-level aims.  These are the national marine research and innovation strategy, or Ocean Knowledge 2030; research to address climate change issues such as rising sea levels, ocean acidification, fish distribution and abundance changes; increasing the resilience of our coastal infrastructure; and, finally, expanding our understanding of, and informing our behaviours towards, the marine environment and its resources. I thank the Cathaoirleach and members for the opportunity to make a presentation.  I look forward to taking questions on my role, as do my team, and giving as comprehensive an update as possible of the work that is under way in the Department and its direction of travel.",

  "Exact Text": "I have been engaging with farm representative organisa­ tions about how we can work together on that.  I am considering it because there is great po­ tential.  We thankfully made good progress last year and we want to continue to support it.  We discussed the infant formula previously.  The key overall point, regardless of which product we are talking about, is the pre-eminence of the Irish grass-based dairy production system and how it is sought after for all products because of its quality.  Likewise, we see that Irish dairy milk is a highly sought after core ingredient for infant formula. We saw expansion of the herd with the removal of quotas in 2014.  That led to an increase in emissions.  Our capacity to produce dairy had been significantly constrained since 1984, when quotas first came in.  We produce dairy well in this country with our grass-based production system and have high-quality milk.  The reason that Kerrygold butter is so popular around the world is that it is a different, grass-based product and that is based on the grass-----",

  "Exact Text": "Regarding whether we should decrease the herd, we are not looking to reduce our food production.  We are looking to reduce the emissions footprint. The parallel I would make is to 1998 to 2011.  We just discussed the removal of dairy quotas and its impact.  From 1998 to 2011, Irish farmers and the agricultural sector reduced their emissions footprint by 15%.  That was prior to any climate action plans or the public policy emphasis we are putting on the issue now.  Farmers, by doing what they do better and innovating all the time, reduced their footprint by 15% over that period.  It increased because of the dairy capacity but over the last three or four years, we have seen livestock numbers plateau again.  There was actu­ ally a slight reduction last year.  Our objective now has to be to work together under the climate action plan with the various policies and supports we are putting in place to assist farming and agriculture to do what it already did before and reduce our emissions footprint in a proactive way while adding value to what we do in the process. The LULUCF targets will be informed by the land use review and getting the fullest esti­ mate of our national position.  We will set the targets based on that.  We are continuing the work in the meantime.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank the committee for the invitation and the opportunity to discuss the agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry chapter of the Climate Change Advisory Council’s annual review.  We have binding commitments to deliver on reducing emissions, through the Paris Agreement and as a member of the EU, and at home through our targets set out in the climate Act.  The Government has committed to a whole-of-economy 51% reductions target by 2030 and to reducing by 25% the agriculture sector’s emissions by 2030.  In response, Ireland’s Climate Action Plan 2023 sets outs how we can accelerate the actions and measures required to respond to the climate crisis, ensuring climate solutions are at the centre of Ireland’s social and economic development.  The climate action plan commits the agriculture sector to strong climate action and I have introduced measures to achieve abatement potential in the agriculture sector. The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan, with a budget of €9.8 billion, will support farmers to transition to more sustainable practices while also supporting family farm incomes.  In addition, we have provided a budget of €1.5 billion for the new agri-environment scheme, ACRES, a fivefold increase in funding for organic farming to €256 million, designed to triple to 7.5% the area of utilised agricultural area for organics, and €260 million to improve the carbon efficiency of the suckler herd through genetic improvement. I also committed €43 million for a major genotyping programme for Irish cattle in May last.  This programme will enhance the environmental sustainability, health and productivity of Irish beef and dairy herds.  This is a voluntary genotyping programme, which is available to both beef and dairy herd owners, and will run over a five-year period from 2023 until 2027. It represents a significant step towards genotyping of the national bovine herd.  By harnessing genetic data, the programme will empower Irish farmers to make informed breeding decisions, optimise herd management and animal welfare and contribute towards Ireland’s climate action targets. The implementation of a low methane emitting breeding programme has significant poten­ tial to harness the genetic variation for methane emissions that exists within the national herd. This, in turn, will bring about permanent and cumulative reductions in the methane output of future generations of livestock.  The results of the research also highlight the potential to breed more environmentally sustainable animals while not having a negative impact on food produc­ tion.  Progress continues to be made in relation to feed additives, which will have a significant positive impact on reducing emissions. This year has seen the introduction of a national fertiliser database.  This will allow my Department to collect a range of information on fertiliser products as well as details of fertiliser economic operators and end users.  It will also support farmers in reducing usage and engaging with industry-led sustainability measurement.  Nitrogen reduction is also supported through the continuation of aid for low-emission slurry spreading, LESS, equipment.  Over 5,100 applica­ tions have been paid in full under the LESS measure of the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme 2 since its launch in 2015.  From 2023, funding for this measure will increase from 40% to 60% under the recently launched TAMS 3 scheme.  Alongside reducing the chemical fertiliser allowances for farmers under nitrates legislation, we are encouraging the adoption of protected urea, which will help to achieve ammonia emissions targets in addition to greenhouse gas emissions reductions.  These changes can have benefits for the environment as well as prof­ itability at farm level through a reduction in input costs. My Department is also supporting the taking and analysis of up to 90, ples through phase 2 of the soil sampling and analysis programme over the next 12 to 18 months.  Phase 2 will build on data gathered during the initial programme by providing valuable information to farmers to inform decisions that promote the health of their soils. Nutrient management and soil health are central to achieving economic and environmental sustainability on farms.  The Department has allocated €8.8 million to this programme, on top of €2.5 million for a multispecies sward scheme next year.  These supports will enable farmers to reduce chemical fertiliser inputs, an economic benefit to the farmer and an environmental benefit to society while maintaining food production. We know that some livestock farmers will take up diversification options that are provided as part of our climate transformation including areas such as organics, forestry, tillage and the production of renewables.  However, given the efficiency gains that continue to be made at farm level, I remain confident that we will continue to reduce emissions in the agrifood sector with­ out reducing our agrifood output through the following measures.  On agri-centric biomethane production, it is estimated that up to 160,000 ha of land could be needed for an expanded AD industry of 5.7 TWh, to grow feedstock of 1.3 million tonnes of dry matter assuming 8 tonnes of grass dry matter per hectare.  A strategy to guide the development of this sector, co-led by my Department and the Department of the Environment, Climate Action and Communications is being finalised for publication shortly.  Indeed, it is being chaired by Mr. Bill Callanan here, an assistant secretary in my Department, in terms of co-ordinating across Departments in the production of that strategy. With regard to tillage, our target as set out in the climate action plan is to increase the area of land devoted to tillage production to 400,000 ha by 2030, building on an increased area of 6% in 2022 over 2021 to approximately 339,000 ha.  This will help build in greater resilience and self-sufficiency in terms of feedstocks and food security.  Under the food vision strategy, a group focused on tillage has been meeting under the chairmanship of Mr. Matt Dempsey to propose recommendations on delivering on this ambition. The new organic farming scheme opened up for applications in autumn of this year and resulted in a doubling of the number of farmers farming organically.  In addition, substantial advisory supports have been introduced for organic farming.  The Agricultural Consultants As­ sociation has received funding from my Department last year and this year to upskill advisers and hold organic farm walks.  Teagasc and my Department jointly fund the new growing organ­ ics monitor farm programme, which was launched in spring of this year and will run for five years promoting best practice at farm level. With regard to forestry, carbon sequestration is one of a range of important services being provided by sustainably managed forests.  The new forestry programme, which was launched in September 2023, as well as developing, adopting and assessing Coillte’s strategic vision, will enable us to capture additional carbon dioxide in forestry, soils and wood products by 2050. On knowledge transfer, the Teagasc signpost programme, supported by my Department, is working with Irish farmers and a partnership of over 60 partner and supporter organisations across the agrifood sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce ammonia emissions, reduce nutrient losses, enhance biodiversity and improve the efficiency of food production. A cohort of 100 signpost demonstration farms is at the centre of the signpost programme and covers all mainland-based enterprises.  The objective of the signpost farms will be to employ the emerging new technologies, such as new breeding programmes and feed additives, and to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from these farms to every farm in Ireland. With the support of my Department, Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Bord Bia are jointly developing a toolkit of tailored farm sustainability support and solutions for Irish farmers called AgNav.  From 2024, it is targeted that 10,000 farmers will be utilising the platform each year.  The platform will enable analysis at individual farm level of emissions and aid the farmer together with his or her climate adviser to identify the best measures on climate action and sustainability for implementation on his or her farm. Critical to delivering our 2030 and 2050 commitments are science, innovation and knowl­ edge exchange.  Research supported by my Department and other public research funders will provide new tools and technologies to mitigate and offset agricultural emissions, which was profiled earlier this month at our inaugural Science into Action conference.  Over the past ten years, my Department has allocated just under €60 million on climate, agri-environment and biodiversity research in agriculture.  This is comprised of: €46.5 million on climate, greenhouse gas emission mitigation, adaptation, carbon sequestration, national inventories and climate- related co-benefit research; and €12.9 million on agri-environment for improving water quality and reducing ammonia emissions. By way of practical example, in 2020 my Department provided funding of over €2 million for the establishment of a national agricultural soil carbon observatory by supplying the scien­ tific infrastructure to measure greenhouse gas fluxes from soils under agricultural management. This technology will enable researchers to assess the impact of reduced management intensity on organic soils under agricultural management which is a key action area under the 2023 cli­ mate action plan.  This project comprises of 30 flux towers spread across a range of soil types, under different management regimes throughout Ireland.  The project is placing Ireland very much at the forefront of EU carbon sequestration research. My officials are collaborating closely with the Environmental Protection Agency and the relevant technical experts to enhance the projections modelling on the mitigation measures identified in the climate action plan.  It is important that this collaboration ensures that gaps in the research are identified and recommendations are made for the improvement of the inventory from a forestry, agriculture and land use and land use change perspective. I thank the Chathaoirleach and the members who will speak here today.  I look forward to engaging in the question and answer session.",

  "Exact Text": "I thank the Cathaoirleach.  Going back to dairying and whether that produces the food developing countries need, many products come out of our dairy sector.  There is no doubt the food is very nutritious and a very worthwhile part of a balanced diet.  It is a strong part of our diet, but also something that can really add to nutrition in many parts of the world.  For example, I was in Nigeria a few months ago and while it does not buy cheese from us it buys milk powders for general consumption in small plastic packs.  That is the main dairy product we send out.  It is bought in shops in powder form and then mixed with water and drunk as a staple drink by people.  It is a very low-cost, nutritious product in that country and there is strong market for it there.  Again, Nigeria is country that is not self- sufficient in food at the moment.  It had a great agricultural tradition, but because of domestic management challenges and economic challenges a country that used to be a net exporter of food is now a net importer of food.  It is a country with a population of 200 million and it is growing rapidly.  It is expected to have 500 million people by 2050 and become one of the larg­ est countries in the world.  That population trajectory indicates a significant food demand.  The dairy product going there is not what we are used to or would find especially palatable either, but it is something that is quite popular and very economically sought-after as a nutritious food product there.  Obviously, right across the sector our objective is to maximise the value from what we do, but with milk and dairy production our grass-based system, when compared with the primarily grain-based system used in the vast majority of other countries, means we have lower costs and a more sustainable model in terms of how we produce it.  It therefore has an important role not just in high value markets but also as an example in relation to African mar­ kets as milk powders. On new measures in the climate action plan, we continue to engage with research organisa­ tions, especially Teagasc, which developed the first marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, that fed into our climate action plan.  Teagasc recently published an updated MACC looking at potential options and opportunities for diversification and new measures.  We continue to look to see what is possible, because we want to do as much as we can and as much as we can deliver upon.  For example, the very rapidly evolving research around feed additives is one of the spaces that can make a difference there.  Another one is the capacity around anaerobic diges­ tion.  The Cathaoirleach is correct we must balance and consider that.  We have set out targets that could see 10% of our total national gas usage by 2030 delivered through farms through anaerobic digestion.  That leads to alternative land use where farmers decide to do that because it will be profitable for them to do so.  As we go forward we must, in our policy environment, see how we balance one against the other.  I have no doubt that, in the decades ahead, ensuring that there is food security internationally will be balanced against how land is used for energy. The issue of fugitive gas emissions will have to be central.  Any use of anaerobic digestion, AD, is going to have to be sustainable.  To drive this, it is important that the feed crop be grown in a sustainable way by using natural, good, fertile and healthy soil for natural types of legume and other plants.",

That led to a distortion of the bal­ ance between agriculture’s various sectors, as dairy could not expand.  Following the removal of quotas at European level, we saw an expansion in the dairy herd.  There has now been a sta­ bilisation and, indeed, a small net reduction of the cattle herd in the past year or two.  Dairy has found its level.  The objective is to focus on reducing the herd’s emissions.",

The approach in the current Effort Sharing Decision, in terms of greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2020, treats emissions from agriculture in essentially the same way as emissions from sectors such as transport and does not take into account the limited cost-effective mitiga­ tion options available in the sector. While the 2020 targets remain binding, Ireland has engaged in intensive discussions with the European Commission to highlight the importance of ensuring a coherent approach to the twin challenges of food security and the greatly increased global demand for food with EU climate-change ambition.  An important step forward in developing a coherent policy on food security and climate change was taken at the October 2014 European Council. Officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine and other Departments are continuing to work together to ensure a whole of Government approach to building upon this and working with the Commission to ensure that EU climate and food policies to 2030 and beyond recognise the reality of these global challenges.",

  "Exact Text": "'greenhouse gas emissions' That is a very fair question.  Applying a 20% reduction target does not mean that we apply 20% reduction across each sector.  Some sectors have more capac­ ity than others to reduce emissions.  It is true that other sectors will have to do more than 20%, because I believe agriculture does not have the capacity to achieve those numbers. That said, agriculture will play its part, and I am determined that it will.  It is already playing its part, but the targets I am setting for agriculture are related to the emissions intensity of what we do.  If Ireland is producing milk at the lowest carbon footprint in the world relative to other countries, does it make sense, in terms of a global climate change challenge, for the country that is doing the best job in producing milk at a low emissions intensity to reduce its herd size and produce less to allow other countries, that are producing at a higher emissions intensity, to produce more?  The markets are going to demand more anyway.  The point we have been mak­ ing at European level, both throughout the CAP process and since then, is that we must combine the joint challenges of a responsible approach towards climate change in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change challenges while at the same time responding to global food security issues. I hope Ireland will set the global benchmark for how to produce food at a low emissions intensity.  We will use science, innovation, breeding and grazing programmes, feed conversion efficiency management and all the other elements we are applying on Irish farms.  In addition, we will audit and measure the performance on our farms.  Every farming organisation in the country has signed up to all dairy farms in the country having a sustainability audit system on farms.  Currently, we are measuring the greenhouse gas emissions from the herds on 48,000 beef farms.  Ireland is the only country in the world doing this.  Anyone who suggests that I, the Government and Ireland are not taking emissions from the agricultural sector seriously does not understand what we are doing.  What I will not do is reduce herd size, when we have a good emissions record, to facilitate blunt targets that only apply to Ireland.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "That is a very fair question.  Applying a 20% reduction target does not mean that we apply 20% reduction across each sector.  Some sectors have more capac­ ity than others to reduce emissions.  It is true that other sectors will have to do more than 20%, because I believe agriculture does not have the capacity to achieve those numbers. That said, agriculture will play its part, and I am determined that it will.  It is already playing its part, but the targets I am setting for agriculture are related to the emissions intensity of what we do.  If Ireland is producing milk at the lowest carbon footprint in the world relative to other countries, does it make sense, in terms of a global climate change challenge, for the country that is doing the best job in producing milk at a low emissions intensity to reduce its herd size and produce less to allow other countries, that are producing at a higher emissions intensity, to produce more?  The markets are going to demand more anyway.  The point we have been mak­ ing at European level, both throughout the CAP process and since then, is that we must combine the joint challenges of a responsible approach towards climate change in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change challenges while at the same time responding to global food security issues. I hope Ireland will set the global benchmark for how to produce food at a low emissions intensity.  We will use science, innovation, breeding and grazing programmes, feed conversion efficiency management and all the other elements we are applying on Irish farms.  In addition, we will audit and measure the performance on our farms.  Every farming organisation in the country has signed up to all dairy farms in the country having a sustainability audit system on farms.  Currently, we are measuring the greenhouse gas emissions from the herds on 48,000 beef farms.  Ireland is the only country in the world doing this.  Anyone who suggests that I, the Government and Ireland are not taking emissions from the agricultural sector seriously does not understand what we are doing.  What I will not do is reduce herd size, when we have a good emissions record, to facilitate blunt targets that only apply to Ireland.",

Accusations have been made around the lack of priority for the sustainability story of Irish food production and that there is a sole focus on output, growth, expansion and so on.  Those accusations do not recognise the extraordinary work that Ireland has undertaken in the past three or four years on the sustainability agenda, including auditing sustainability on farms, processing facilities and so on.  The Origin Green programme is what makes the Irish food production system different from most of our competitors.  By the end of next year we hope that all food and drink exported from Ireland will be from companies and farmers, who are responsible for the primary production of that food, that have signed up to the Origin Green programme - in other words, that have invited audits in respect of the sustainabil­ ity of how they produce that food.  That is the approach we are taking. We are going to be setting up a dairy forum.  Sustainability will be a big part of that discus­ sion, as will the financial management of growth and the technology and innovation that can help us get better results in a more sustainable way than in the past. Any old fool can reduce emissions by simply reducing production.  There is no challenge in that.  The challenge for the globe and for Ireland, in terms of giving leadership in this area, is finding a way to produce more food while reducing the overall emissions footprint of our production systems.  It has to be all about the emissions intensity of a litre of milk or a kilo of beef.  Ireland has to find ways of doing that and we are investing heavily in this area.  This is why we have the new beef genomics scheme, for example.  The idea is that we can breed better animals which grow faster and are slaughtered earlier.  As a result, emissions during their life­ time are lower because they are killed at 20 or 22 months rather than 30 or 32 months.  That is the approach that I have taken from a sustainability point of view.  Essentially, An Taisce seems to be suggesting that the way in which agriculture must play its part in terms of the global cli­ mate change challenge is by simply reducing our herd size.  That is not a sustainable approach towards a global problem.",

  "Exact Text": "'agrifood sector' I thank the Deputy for asking the question.  We have already had a discussion on it.  When the Food Harvest 2020 targets were set and the policy was put in place by the previous Government, the three buzzwords were smart, green and growth.  This is fundamentally what we are trying to do in agriculture.  We are trying to get growth while ensuring it is based on innovation and new and better ways of doing things and in a way that is green and protects the environment, watercourses, biodiversity, rural life and rural incomes in the best way we possibly can with regard to reducing the emissions intensity of food production systems. We are the only country in the world that is auditing farmers and how they run their farms from a sustainability point of view.  This is what has been rolled out over the past two years on beef farms and what is being rolled out on dairy farms.  Farmers sign up to outsiders coming in and auditing them once every 18 months.  This is a sustainability audit system which has international certification. We are planning growth and expansion between now and 2020.  A group of people is plan­ ning for growth between now and 2025 to replace the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  The sector constantly needs a ten-year horizon for ambitions so that we all know where we are going and what we are trying to finance with regard to growth and strategy.  By the middle of the summer we will launch a new 2025 strategy for agrifood expansion and growth and technological ad­ vancement.  A major part of the challenge is sustainability.  People should not simply state that as our target is to reduce emissions by 20%, agriculture must apply that 20% reduction.  It is a much more complex argument than this.  I assure the Deputy we will do everything we can and we will be a global leader in finding ways to reduce the emissions intensity of our food produc­ tion systems, but we will allow the country to fulfil its full potential in terms of the volumes of food we are capable of producing from the national resources we have.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I thank the Deputy for asking the question.  We have already had a discussion on it.  When the Food Harvest 2020 targets were set and the policy was put in place by the previous Government, the three buzzwords were smart, green and growth.  This is fundamentally what we are trying to do in agriculture.  We are trying to get growth while ensuring it is based on innovation and new and better ways of doing things and in a way that is green and protects the environment, watercourses, biodiversity, rural life and rural incomes in the best way we possibly can with regard to reducing the emissions intensity of food production systems. We are the only country in the world that is auditing farmers and how they run their farms from a sustainability point of view.  This is what has been rolled out over the past two years on beef farms and what is being rolled out on dairy farms.  Farmers sign up to outsiders coming in and auditing them once every 18 months.  This is a sustainability audit system which has international certification. We are planning growth and expansion between now and 2020.  A group of people is plan­ ning for growth between now and 2025 to replace the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.  The sector constantly needs a ten-year horizon for ambitions so that we all know where we are going and what we are trying to finance with regard to growth and strategy.  By the middle of the summer we will launch a new 2025 strategy for agrifood expansion and growth and technological ad­ vancement.  A major part of the challenge is sustainability.  People should not simply state that as our target is to reduce emissions by 20%, agriculture must apply that 20% reduction.  It is a much more complex argument than this.  I assure the Deputy we will do everything we can and we will be a global leader in finding ways to reduce the emissions intensity of our food produc­ tion systems, but we will allow the country to fulfil its full potential in terms of the volumes of food we are capable of producing from the national resources we have.",

  "Exact Text": "'greenhouse gas emissions' That is not reflected either in the Deputy’s introduction to this question or the previous questions he has asked of my Department. The recent figures that the Deputy refers to are provisional greenhouse gas emissions figures for 2015.  Although they indicate a 1.5% increase in agriculture emissions, these figures include an additional category of emissions that were not included in previous inventories.  The figures indicate an increase in dairy cows but they also demonstrate a decrease in other cattle, and this is in line with expectations where it is envisaged there will be reorientation of the national herd towards dairy.  It is also worth noting that milk production increased 13.2%, which indicates a decrease in emissions intensity of production.  This reflects national plans to expand milk pro­ duction under Food Wise 2025 following the removal of milk quotas in 2015. Any increase in emissions is a concern but I point out that Irish agriculture has made signifi­ cant progress in improving efficiency.  We have been driving down emissions intensity and in 2013 the emissions intensity per calorie of food output reduced by approximately 14% relative to 2005 and overall absolute emissions remain 2.7% below 2005 levels.  We have introduced a range of measures in our rural development plan to make Irish farming even more environmen­ tally sustainable. We will continue our efforts to ensure the sector can grow, prosper and meet the increasing world demand for food in a sustainable manner.  I am committed to maintaining our ambition to move towards carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.",

We have a serious problem, because what is necessary in this country is quite a radical restructuring of the way in which we farm. The outcomes of the latest meeting include Ireland’s being allowed to continue to ramp up its milk production, which the Minister is obviously delighted about, but it fails to take into ac­ count that ramping up beef and milk production has serious consequences for the climate.  Milk output is expected to increase from 5 billion litres to 8.5 billion litres by 2020.  The Minister is on the record as saying that this means exporting an extra €1 billion worth of milk.  It means increasing the herd size by between 300,000 and 400,000 cows, which, Deputy Coveney stated, will make Ireland the fastest growing dairy producer on the planet for the next five years and, he went on to state, probably the next ten years.  This is not good, and I do not say that lightly. I say it, actually, in a thoughtful manner.  Ireland’s 1.1 million cows produce huge amounts of methane, as well as nitrous oxide, another powerful greenhouse gas.  Methane, as the Minister will be aware, is 20 times worse, as a driver of climate change, than carbon dioxide over 100 years.  Ireland’s agricultural sector accounts for one third of national greenhouse gas emissions. That is three times the EU average or, in the words of the Department, the highest proportion of any country in the developed world.  It is simply unsustainable. The Minister told us in November 2014 that planning a boom in dairy and beef exports by increasing the size of the herd could be done while maintaining the existing carbon footprint of the agricultural sector.  He was wrong in that regard.  It is not true.  That is not what happened. Agricultural emissions, which already make up 30% of Ireland’s total, are expected to grow by a further 12%, according to the EPA, thanks to the impact of Food Harvest 2020 and the removal of milk quotas.  That is an unthinkable increase in the context of the Paris agreement and the absolutely dire need that Ireland has now to cut its emissions.  We have spoken about it here previously. Ireland is an emissions disaster.  On a per capita basis, we currently emit 75% more green­ house gases than China.  We are the second worst per capita polluter in Europe, after Poland.

  "Exact Text": "'agriculture and fisheries council meeting: statements' No, we are not.  Ramping up production of dairy and beef and arguing at EU level for the right to continue to do so, as the Minister did last week, is incredibly short­ sighted and will drive us into further costs, environmentally and financially.  One of the key actions we must take is to turn away from beef and dairy towards more sustainable agriculture, and changing our diet is a key part of it.  We should eat far less red meat and dairy, and it must be among our Government health promotion initiatives.  The UK’s Chatham House has pointed out that, despite their vast contribution to climate change, beef and dairy production attracts very little policy attention.  We must change this.  One can make a compelling case that without dietary change at a global level, the 2° Celsius global warming goal is pretty much off the table. As a means of converting calories into food, red meat production is staggeringly inefficient. Recent research has found that producing one calorie of beef requires 160 times more land and produces 11 to 48 times more greenhouse gases than producing food such as potatoes or rice. One of the most significant changes we could make to effect climate mitigation would be to eat less meat.  It would also do our cancer rates no end of good and, probably, contribute to the rising battle against obesity.  The Minister should persuade the Government of the benefits of this as well as pursue serious changes in the structure of agriculture.  However, the Minister is doing the opposite.  Justin Kilcullen of Trócaire has rightly said the policies the Minister is pursuing regarding beef and dairy production have nothing to contribute to world food security. If anything, they will achieve the opposite in the long run.  They are inefficient. The Minister is fond of saying we are the most sustainable, and he piped up with it a minute ago.  It is arguable.  I would not say we are the most sustainable.  While we are not the least sustainable, but the fact that we are not the worst of a bad lot is not something we should crow about.  Not only are Irish beef and dairy farming unsustainable for the environment, they are economically unviable.  The Irish beef sector survives only thanks to generous EU subsidies. Without EU subsidies, averaging approximately €400 per hectare, many Irish beef farms could not survive.  As we fail to reach our emissions target, thanks to Government policies such as Harvest 2020, we will be hit by massive fines of up to approximately €500 million per year. These fines will land on the shoulders of the Irish taxpayer, making cattle farming even less sustainable, never mind the cost of climate change and the impact it will have.  Dr. Stephen Flood of NUI Maynooth has estimated losses of up to €2 billion per year linked to agriculture and climate change costs.  It is huge. We must step back from how we have done things, relentlessly driving beef and dairy farm­ ing forward.  There must be a shift in policy, such as switching cattle farms to alternative land uses such as bioenergy crops or forestry, which could ultimately lead to a more secure and bal­ anced income outcome for farmers.  A shift to forestry would, ironically, help with the flood situation which has become a permanent feature.  If we do not do it, there will be a catastrophic outcome for all Irish citizens, including Irish farmers.  We cannot focus only on short-term income. Large vested interests stand in the way of any such change and they must be tackled.  Glan­ bia, which in 2014 routed its €40 million profits through a brass plate company with no em­ ployees in Luxembourg to cut its tax bill to only 0.5%, is happy to lump Ireland with these costs.  However, the Minister should not be happy regarding the welfare of the nation, including farmers.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "No, we are not.  Ramping up production of dairy and beef and arguing at EU level for the right to continue to do so, as the Minister did last week, is incredibly short­ sighted and will drive us into further costs, environmentally and financially.  One of the key actions we must take is to turn away from beef and dairy towards more sustainable agriculture, and changing our diet is a key part of it.  We should eat far less red meat and dairy, and it must be among our Government health promotion initiatives.  The UK’s Chatham House has pointed out that, despite their vast contribution to climate change, beef and dairy production attracts very little policy attention.  We must change this.  One can make a compelling case that without dietary change at a global level, the 2° Celsius global warming goal is pretty much off the table. As a means of converting calories into food, red meat production is staggeringly inefficient. Recent research has found that producing one calorie of beef requires 160 times more land and produces 11 to 48 times more greenhouse gases than producing food such as potatoes or rice. One of the most significant changes we could make to effect climate mitigation would be to eat less meat.  It would also do our cancer rates no end of good and, probably, contribute to the rising battle against obesity.  The Minister should persuade the Government of the benefits of this as well as pursue serious changes in the structure of agriculture.  However, the Minister is doing the opposite.  Justin Kilcullen of Trócaire has rightly said the policies the Minister is pursuing regarding beef and dairy production have nothing to contribute to world food security. If anything, they will achieve the opposite in the long run.  They are inefficient. The Minister is fond of saying we are the most sustainable, and he piped up with it a minute ago.  It is arguable.  I would not say we are the most sustainable.  While we are not the least sustainable, but the fact that we are not the worst of a bad lot is not something we should crow about.  Not only are Irish beef and dairy farming unsustainable for the environment, they are economically unviable.  The Irish beef sector survives only thanks to generous EU subsidies. Without EU subsidies, averaging approximately €400 per hectare, many Irish beef farms could not survive.  As we fail to reach our emissions target, thanks to Government policies such as Harvest 2020, we will be hit by massive fines of up to approximately €500 million per year. These fines will land on the shoulders of the Irish taxpayer, making cattle farming even less sustainable, never mind the cost of climate change and the impact it will have.  Dr. Stephen Flood of NUI Maynooth has estimated losses of up to €2 billion per year linked to agriculture and climate change costs.  It is huge. We must step back from how we have done things, relentlessly driving beef and dairy farm­ ing forward.  There must be a shift in policy, such as switching cattle farms to alternative land uses such as bioenergy crops or forestry, which could ultimately lead to a more secure and bal­ anced income outcome for farmers.  A shift to forestry would, ironically, help with the flood situation which has become a permanent feature.  If we do not do it, there will be a catastrophic outcome for all Irish citizens, including Irish farmers.  We cannot focus only on short-term income. Large vested interests stand in the way of any such change and they must be tackled.  Glan­ bia, which in 2014 routed its €40 million profits through a brass plate company with no em­ ployees in Luxembourg to cut its tax bill to only 0.5%, is happy to lump Ireland with these costs.  However, the Minister should not be happy regarding the welfare of the nation, including farmers.",

In terms of the carbon footprint per kilo of output our dairy industry is the most efficient in the world and our beef is the fifth most efficient.  Whether we are fifth, sixth or first, we all acknowledge that in the dairy and beef sectors we must do far more.  The industry is up for it.

Farmers there are leading the way in terms of their embrace of new technologies and ideas, especially carbon footprint measuring on farms.  We are extraordinarily efficient in this regard.  The post-dairy quota era has proven that we have broken the link between increased output and increasing greenhouse gas production.  Since 2015 we have increased our dairy production by 13.2% but our greenhouse gas emissions have only gone up by 1.6%.  This is significant in that we are breaking the link between increased production and increased green­ house gas emissions. We need to continue that direction of travel.  There is real goodwill and willingness on the part of the agricultural community to play its part.

  "Exact Text": "'environmental policy' That is not true.  We have few natural resources and one of the great natural resources we have is grass.  A grass-based production system is the most carbon- efficient way to produce dairy or beef.  If one looks at those two sectors in particular, we are the most carbon-efficient producer of dairy on the planet.  New Zealand and Ireland are the most carbon-efficient.  In the European Union, we are the fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef.  The logic of what the Deputy is saying is that we should dismantle our natural advantages in having a sustainable production system, and bear this in mind with regard to our competitor countries on the market.  I know the Deputy has a jaundiced view of the market but he was in it himself once upon a time.  In the Netherlands, for example, a premium is paid for cows that are outside for a couple of hours a day.  Ours are outside 24-7, for almost 365 days a year.  That is because our system is sustainable. Deputy Wallace made reference to Food Wise 2025.  I chair the implementation committee of that on a monthly basis, and in fact I chaired a session of it today, when we had the dairy industry in to discuss the area of infant formula.  One of the critical elements of that industry is its badge of sustainability.  It is fully signed up members of the orange and green project, for example, which is committed to meeting the highest standards of sustainability because that is what the consumer and retailers want and what Irish farmers are responding to.  I appreciate that Deputy Wallace and I engage in what may be called a “dialogue of the deaf” but I am anxious that people know the bone fides of Irish agriculture, what it has achieved to date and what it is committed to achieving.  It is unfair to our agricultural industry to repeatedly, and without foun­ dation, point the finger at it as if it was a blackguard in terms of the environmental challenge we face.  It is up for the battle.  It has done an awful lot to date and is committed to meeting the requirements that we face.  The challenges that we face are two-fold, as recognised in the Paris Accord.  They include a growing global population and climate change and reducing our car­ bon.  We have a food production system that is carbon efficient and will become more efficient.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "That is not true.  We have few natural resources and one of the great natural resources we have is grass.  A grass-based production system is the most carbon- efficient way to produce dairy or beef.  If one looks at those two sectors in particular, we are the most carbon-efficient producer of dairy on the planet.  New Zealand and Ireland are the most carbon-efficient.  In the European Union, we are the fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef.  The logic of what the Deputy is saying is that we should dismantle our natural advantages in having a sustainable production system, and bear this in mind with regard to our competitor countries on the market.  I know the Deputy has a jaundiced view of the market but he was in it himself once upon a time.  In the Netherlands, for example, a premium is paid for cows that are outside for a couple of hours a day.  Ours are outside 24-7, for almost 365 days a year.  That is because our system is sustainable. Deputy Wallace made reference to Food Wise 2025.  I chair the implementation committee of that on a monthly basis, and in fact I chaired a session of it today, when we had the dairy industry in to discuss the area of infant formula.  One of the critical elements of that industry is its badge of sustainability.  It is fully signed up members of the orange and green project, for example, which is committed to meeting the highest standards of sustainability because that is what the consumer and retailers want and what Irish farmers are responding to.  I appreciate that Deputy Wallace and I engage in what may be called a “dialogue of the deaf” but I am anxious that people know the bone fides of Irish agriculture, what it has achieved to date and what it is committed to achieving.  It is unfair to our agricultural industry to repeatedly, and without foun­ dation, point the finger at it as if it was a blackguard in terms of the environmental challenge we face.  It is up for the battle.  It has done an awful lot to date and is committed to meeting the requirements that we face.  The challenges that we face are two-fold, as recognised in the Paris Accord.  They include a growing global population and climate change and reducing our car­ bon.  We have a food production system that is carbon efficient and will become more efficient.",

  "Exact Text": "'greenhouse gas emissions' The analogy between Irish agriculture and the coal industry is rather unfortunate.  Ireland has a comparative advantage in grass-based, carbon-efficient live­ stock production.  The European Commission Joint Research Centre report of 2010 found Ire­ land was the most carbon-efficient producer in the European Union per unit of dairy production and the fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef per kilogram.  Notwithstanding this, inher­ ent challenges remain for the sector in contributing to Ireland’s climate change and renewable energy targets.  It should also be noted that policy development regarding the Common Agri­ cultural Policy, CAP, has seen the decoupling of CAP direct payments from livestock numbers since 2005. The Government’s current policy position for the agriculture sector is an approach to carbon neutrality that does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production.  There are three strands to my Department’s approach to carbon neutrality: reducing agricultural emissions; in­ creasing carbon sequestration; and displacing and substituting fossil fuels and energy-intensive materials. An example of my continued focus on ensuring the lowering of the carbon footprint of the agriculture sector is my recent launch of a beef environmental efficiency pilot scheme specifi­ cally aimed at further improving the carbon efficiency of the beef sector.  Sequestration has a key role to play in reducing the carbon footprint of the sector.  My Department has made a significant investment under the forestry programme.  In 2018, €106 million was made avail­ able by my Department to support afforestation and other forest initiatives.  The sector also has a key role to play in the supply of biomass materials, adopting energy efficiency measures and renewable technologies on farm, as well as on-site energy generation, all of which can provide profitability gains which underpin the sustainable production system. My Department continues to review options that will enable farmers to transition to a low- carbon economy.  The recently published Teagasc report, An Analysis of Abatement Potential of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Irish Agriculture 2021-2030, is key to informing the type of measures on which we need to focus into the future to continue to reduce the carbon footprint of the sector.  While the mitigation potential for agriculture is limited, agriculture can and must play a key role in contributing to Ireland’s climate change and energy targets in the years ahead.",

  "Exact Text": "'greenhouse gas emissions' The compilation of the agricultural greenhouse gas inven­ tory is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  As part of this process, the EPA determines the total amount of methane, N2O and CO2 emissions generated by the aggregation of all farms.  The EPA takes activity data, for example, total animal numbers by category or fertiliser sales data and applies an emissions factor to determine total emissions.  Carbon mea­ surement at farm level will become ever more important in the context of the recently agreed sectoral emissions ceilings of a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for agriculture and as a mechanism to demonstrate environmental ambition at farm level. Through the Bord Bia sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme, SBLAS, and the sus­ tainably dairy assurance scheme, SDAS, introduced in 2014, we have a solid foundation on which to build.  To date, more than 300,000 carbon footprint calculations have been completed. The Bord Bia quality assurance audit process for beef and dairy farmers facilitates the collec­ tion of the relevant farm management data required to complete a carbon footprint calculation via the sustainability survey. The Department’s animal inventory and movements, AIM, data is utilised to generate an inventory of all animals on a farm for each month of a production year.  Weight gain per animal is derived from a herd’s average daily live weight gain, DLWG, figure which is provided by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, to Bord Bia.  Both models generate a result by tracking all the greenhouses gases emitted as a result of the farm practices required to produce 1 kg of output, that is, “1 kg of fat and protein corrected milk” or 1 kg live weight gain. These emissions can be categorised into emissions from: the digestion of feed; manure man­ agement; fertiliser use; concentrate feeding; and electricity and machinery use.  The emissions are summed up across the beef or dairy production system and divided by the output to generate the carbon footprint. The carbon footprint results are then communicated to members of the schemes via the farmer feedback report.  To date, more than 5,000 farmer feedback reports have been generated and dispatched to SBLAS and SDAS members. Since 2020, Bord Bia has collaborated closely with Teagasc and ICBF to improve the data collection, methodologies and accuracy of the beef and dairy models.",

  "Exact Text": "'climate change policy' I thank the Deputy for his question.  As he is aware, the agriculture sector is required to reduce emissions by between 22% to 30% by 2030, based on a 2018 baseline of 23 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent.  This is a challenging target for the sector, but it is one that also will present opportunities for farmers.  Our farm families are committed to taking a leadership role in meeting our overall climate ambitions and have shown their will­ ingness to do so.  Indeed, it is as much in the interest of farmers as anyone else to do so, if not more so, because no sector of the economy will be more exposed to climate change in the years ahead than agriculture, given our dependence on the weather to be able to produce food.  There will be an even bigger challenge in this regard in other parts of the world that are also facing serious difficulties. The Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve was the original source of information on how to move forward and it has been built upon by both the Ag Climatise roadmap and the climate action plan of 2021.  I recently established a Food Vision 2030 dairy group to set out specific actions on how emissions reduction in the dairy sector will be achieved.  A beef and sheep subgroup with a similar objective will soon be established under the chairmanship of Professor Thia Hennessy. The advisory services both within Teagasc and the private farming consulting network are working closely with farmers to advise them of the transition necessary on their farms.  Teagasc has established a network of model farms under its signpost programme.  These farms are considered best in class when it comes to climate-smart agriculture, supporting peer-to-peer learning between farmers. One of the most important actions farmers can take is to reduce their dependence on chemi­ cal nitrogen.  I have put in place additional supports this year to encourage farmers to transition to clover and multispecies swards.  There is real potential in that and I think we will see a sig­ nificant movement towards that in the years ahead.  This year has brought home the importance of insulating ourselves from the cost challenges of chemical fertiliser while also reducing emis­ sions and enhancing sustainability at farm level.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I thank the Deputy for his question.  As he is aware, the agriculture sector is required to reduce emissions by between 22% to 30% by 2030, based on a 2018 baseline of 23 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent.  This is a challenging target for the sector, but it is one that also will present opportunities for farmers.  Our farm families are committed to taking a leadership role in meeting our overall climate ambitions and have shown their will­ ingness to do so.  Indeed, it is as much in the interest of farmers as anyone else to do so, if not more so, because no sector of the economy will be more exposed to climate change in the years ahead than agriculture, given our dependence on the weather to be able to produce food.  There will be an even bigger challenge in this regard in other parts of the world that are also facing serious difficulties. The Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve was the original source of information on how to move forward and it has been built upon by both the Ag Climatise roadmap and the climate action plan of 2021.  I recently established a Food Vision 2030 dairy group to set out specific actions on how emissions reduction in the dairy sector will be achieved.  A beef and sheep subgroup with a similar objective will soon be established under the chairmanship of Professor Thia Hennessy. The advisory services both within Teagasc and the private farming consulting network are working closely with farmers to advise them of the transition necessary on their farms.  Teagasc has established a network of model farms under its signpost programme.  These farms are considered best in class when it comes to climate-smart agriculture, supporting peer-to-peer learning between farmers. One of the most important actions farmers can take is to reduce their dependence on chemi­ cal nitrogen.  I have put in place additional supports this year to encourage farmers to transition to clover and multispecies swards.  There is real potential in that and I think we will see a sig­ nificant movement towards that in the years ahead.  This year has brought home the importance of insulating ourselves from the cost challenges of chemical fertiliser while also reducing emis­ sions and enhancing sustainability at farm level.",

  "Exact Text": "'agriculture, fisheries and food security: statements' I am delighted to be joined by my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon, over the course of this debate.  I look forward to what I expect will be a constructive and engaging debate this afternoon. We are living, working and farming through a hugely historic and turbulent period for our great agricultural sector.  Even before the illegal invasion of Ukraine and the impact that has had on our sector, our farmers, fishers and food producers have been proactively embracing a new reality of food production.  This is a reality in which we are mandated to feed a growing global population with safe, sustainable and healthy food with an even greater emphasis of doing so in harmony with nature.  At primary producer level, this is a challenge that farmers have grasped with both hands and on which they are leading out.  In fact, I firmly believe that our food sector has been to the forefront of playing a leadership role in climate-proofing our economy.  This underlines that our sector is one that has always been innovating, pioneering and facing down any and all challenges as they arise. I will begin by reflecting on the impact of the war in Ukraine.  On behalf of the Government, once again, I utterly condemn the illegal invasion by Russia of Ukraine.  We are also mindful of the terrible toll being inflicted on Ukrainian citizens.  At a time when we have our stock to grass, lambs and calves are with their mothers in the fields and the buzz of silage season is soon to be upon us, we see our farming counterparts in Ukraine dealing with the realities of war.  What were cornfields are now, in many instances, battlefields.  While we must be cognisant of the awful reality facing the people of Ukraine, our focus is also on attempting to protect our farm families in Ireland from the worst effects of the impacts of the war.  Supply chains have been disrupted and inputs have been extremely volatile. As a Government and as a people, we remain resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine.  We reiterate the call on Russia to cease all hostilities immediately and withdraw from Ukraine unconditionally.  I welcome the strong solidarity shown by Ireland and our people and by the European Union with Ukraine in the face of its illegal invasion.  We will work with EU partners to consider and implement appropriate responses.  This includes ensuring that food security is maintained for EU citizens and the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context. While Ireland has recently come out first in the world on the Economist Impact global food security index, and the European Union is largely self-sufficient for food with a massive agrifood trade surplus, it is important that we do not become complacent about food security. We also need to keep in mind those who are living in countries that are many times less for­ tunate than ours.  Ireland is providing some €20 million in humanitarian assistance to the UN and the Red Cross to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  My Department also provides flexible funding of €25 million per year to the UN World Food Programme, supporting that organisation to provide a flexible, timely response to humanitarian crises. Millions of people have now fled Ukraine to seek refuge in the EU.  We have operated an open-door policy to support any Ukrainians fleeing to here and this will continue to be the case. In my Department, and through the State agencies that report to me, we have played a leader­ ship role.  More than 50 Ukrainians have been welcomed by Teagasc at Ballyhaise College in County Cavan and a further 35 have been welcomed in Clonakilty Agricultural College in County Cork.  I thank both colleges for their efforts. Looking more specifically at both my own and this Government’s response to this crisis, as I said earlier, our clear focus is on insulating our farm families as much as possible from the trade shock suffered as a result of the war and on supporting them in being able to continue to produce the food that is so important domestically and internationally at this time.  Since the invasion of Ukraine, I have taken a proactive approach to dealing with the massive challenges facing our agrifood and fish sectors.  Obviously, farming is not alone in dealing with these chal­ lenges but our great sector is particularly exposed as a result of the invasion, and we are work­ ing hard to support farm families through this situation. I have operated a twin-track approach to the crisis with advisory measures and targeted financial supports for farm families.  In early March, shortly after the invasion occurred, I met the main farm organisations and Teagasc to discuss the impact on Irish agriculture and supply chains.  I also met members of the Irish Grain and Feed Association and representatives of the fertiliser industry.  I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee and tasked it with the preparation of a response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs and with developing contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.  I will continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on this significant challenge. Within my Department, I have also established a rapid response team, chaired by the Sec­ retary General, to monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains actively and to contribute to the whole-of-government response to the crisis.  Over the past two months, I have announced targeted measures worth in the region of €90 million to support the agriculture sector directly, including a €20 million package in two separate parts for the pig sector.  These two separate supports will see €90,000 paid to farmers.  There will also be €12 million for the growing of new tillage crops as well as multispecies swards and red clover, both of which will help reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser.  Furthermore, there will be €3 million for the horticul­ ture sector, a very important domestic market we need to protect.  I was glad to work with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in delivering this.  These measures will help Irish farmers at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the events in Ukraine.  I thank my Cabinet colleagues, and in particular the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for helping to deliver these important supports.  They are real and tangible examples of the Government’s commitment to the agri and farming sectors. As Deputies will be aware, Ireland imports significant volumes of animal feedstuffs, in­ cluding feed from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.  Russia and Ukraine are significant sources of global cereal exports, so the price and the availability of cereals globally have been significantly impacted.  As of today, there appear to be sufficient supplies of animal feed and Irish importers are actively competing in the global market to ensure the supply will continue uninterrupted. Fodder availability on farms for next winter depends on several factors, particularly the level of grass growth and silage production this year, but there appears to be a decent bank of silage on farms carried over from the winter. Nevertheless, it is crucial we do not stand still and expect this to be the case over the coming winter and into the spring.  To that end, I am developing a measure to assist cattle and sheep farmers in producing fodder for next winter and I will shortly release further details on a scheme that will pay farmers up to €1,000 to save hay and silage.  It will be paid at a rate of €100 on the first 10 ha, up to €1,000 per farm.  My key message to farmers concerns the absolute importance of growing grass this year, saving fodder and hay and making use of the growing season that is ahead of us to do that, and I have committed strongly to them that they will be supported in the form of up to €1,000.  I am conscious the war in Ukraine has seen issues with both the afford­ ability and the availability of fertiliser and that this could result in challenges for next winter, which is why I have moved to introduce the scheme.  While most cattle and sheep are now out on grass, I am conscious the winter season is just finishing for some.  We must think prudently when it comes to silage and grain to ensure we will have more than enough to cover the level of stock on an individual farm.  In essence, what farmers plan to breed they must also plan to feed. Even before the war in Ukraine, I was conscious of the rising price of fertiliser and of the overall need to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser.  Accordingly, last October, I tasked Teagasc with developing a roadmap to aid our transition away from using artificial fertilisers. I subsequently launched the Teagasc soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign, a credible plan farmers are already using that will be good both for the environment and for farmers’ pockets and bottom lines.  As we know, Russia accounts for 22% of our fertiliser, so we have to plan in the short and long terms in light of that.  Fertiliser merchants have indicated they are confident they will be able to meet the demand for fertiliser, although there are a number of challenges in sourcing product at the moment.  There may be issues with the availability of certain products at times and importers are active in securing alternative supply lines where necessary.  All farmers are encouraged to review their requirements in order that they can secure fertiliser supply if that is not already in place, and it is important all farms put in place a nutrient management plan to set their farms to grow the grass required for the winter and spring ahead.  Advisers will assist farmers with this plan.  A Teagasc survey found most tillage and dairy farmers have secured their fertiliser requirements for the moment, while dry stock farmers, many of whom plan on spreading less fertiliser on grazing ground, are finding it more difficult to secure their fertiliser requirements.  Almost half of all dry stock farmers who were surveyed two to three weeks ago had yet to spread a chemical fertiliser, a concern that has led me to bring forward the €1,000 scheme to incentivise farmers to save hay and silage. I am also aware of the issues relating to horticulture and have engaged, along with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, with the sector.  Energy is a significant input for many horticultural enterprises, given crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers and mushrooms are grown indoors in glasshouses and protected greenhouse structures.  I am glad to have been able to bring forward a €3 million support package for the sector, working closely with the Minister of State, which will assist high-wire and mushroom growers as well as field-vegetable and apple farmers.  Further details on this support package will be made known shortly. Overall, our sector is one that relies on fuel of various types, from road, agricultural and marine diesel to natural gas.  The year 2020 saw fuel prices at their lowest in a decade, while 2021 and this year have seen fuel prices increase to their highest in a decade.  This is adding a significant additional cost to farmers, processors, road hauliers and the fishing industry.  For many farmers, energy costs have increased by between 80% and 100% in the past year.  While we cannot cover all aspects of the input price increases, we have to take a proactive and rapid step to insulate farm families as best as possible, and that is certainly the approach we have been taking.  I again mention the pig sector and the challenging circumstances it continues to face, which both the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and I are monitoring closely.  Bringing forward that package to the tune of a maximum of €90,000 per farm has been crucial in sup­ porting the sector at this time, and I recognise the work of that Minister of State in sharing the round table on the sector over recent months and working with stakeholders.  We will continue to work to support the sector and to finalise the scheme, which we will launch shortly. The seafood sector has been impacted especially hard by the crisis.  The price of marine fuel remains a matter of concern for our fishing fleet and the broader seafood sector.  This is the most recent crisis to hit our seafood sector in recent years and those crises are having a cumulative impact.  The Government is acutely aware of the impact rising prices are having on businesses throughout the country, but while the European Commission has provided additional flexibility regarding the use of funds under the EU fisheries fund in the context of the fuel crisis, additional funds have not been made available by the EU.  The impacts of Brexit and the trade and co- operation agreement also continue to be a significant concern for our seafood sector and coastal communities.  That is why in recent days, I launched the tie-up scheme, providing for two tie-up opportunities of three months’ duration each.  This will mean boats will have an opportunity to tie up for one month in three and will be paid over the course of that month on an equivalent basis to what their income would have been over that time.  As a result, the remaining two thirds of boats that are fishing in a given month will have a 50% higher quota to fish.  Moreover, it will help improve the margins for the boats that fish in those months, while the other one third of boats will be able to avail of the tie-up scheme at the same time.  The scheme will run in two three-month tranches and will be a strong support for fishermen at what is a challenging time for them. Earlier today, I was glad to be able to announce a €45 million investment in our seafood processing sector.  This, too, is a crucial part of our sector, responsible for more than 4,000 jobs nationally.  While I continue to fight at every opportunity at European level to improve our situation with regard to the national quota, it is crucial we maximise the value of the fish we are catching and the quota we have, and that the value of every fish that is landed will be maximised both for fishers and coastal communities and for employment.  The €45 million sum is an unprecedented investment in our processing sector that is targeted at adding value to the fish we catch in order that we will maximise the value of the fish that is landed and extract the maximum value and income.  Of course, alongside that, as has been the case throughout my tenure as Minister, I will fight tooth and nail at European level, not least in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy review, to seek every way to improve our opportunities regarding our overall national quota.  Since the publication of the report of the seafood task force, Navigating Change, my Department has been working across the board to examine urgently its recom­ mendations.  We have also brought forward a number of schemes over recent months.  The seafood sector is undoubtedly facing one of the most significant challenges in decades, coming immediately after the challenges posed by the pandemic and Brexit.  I will continue to work very closely with the sector to support it. As I said at the beginning, our great agriculture sector is facing some of its most significant challenges, as is our marine sector.  Many of these are challenges we have not seen before.  In times like these, it is crucial that we take a proactive approach and that we take steps to limit any potential disruption to our feed and supply chains.  I know that farmers, fishers and the agrifood sector will rise to these challenges and meet them head on.  By working collectively and col­ laboratively, we can ensure that the sector is insulated against the worst of what may come from supply chain disruption but the coming weeks and months will undoubtedly be challenging.  I want the House to know that I stand in full support of our farmers and fishers, their families and their businesses throughout this period of historic upheaval.  The road ahead will be challenging but we will get through it because it is in our DNA to persevere and flourish in times of adver­ sity.  There are businesses and consumers across the globe who rely on our amazing produce as a source of safe, sustainable and healthy food.  These are our calling cards and what makes our agrifood and fisheries sector the world-class industries they are today.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I am delighted to be joined by my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon, over the course of this debate.  I look forward to what I expect will be a constructive and engaging debate this afternoon. We are living, working and farming through a hugely historic and turbulent period for our great agricultural sector.  Even before the illegal invasion of Ukraine and the impact that has had on our sector, our farmers, fishers and food producers have been proactively embracing a new reality of food production.  This is a reality in which we are mandated to feed a growing global population with safe, sustainable and healthy food with an even greater emphasis of doing so in harmony with nature.  At primary producer level, this is a challenge that farmers have grasped with both hands and on which they are leading out.  In fact, I firmly believe that our food sector has been to the forefront of playing a leadership role in climate-proofing our economy.  This underlines that our sector is one that has always been innovating, pioneering and facing down any and all challenges as they arise. I will begin by reflecting on the impact of the war in Ukraine.  On behalf of the Government, once again, I utterly condemn the illegal invasion by Russia of Ukraine.  We are also mindful of the terrible toll being inflicted on Ukrainian citizens.  At a time when we have our stock to grass, lambs and calves are with their mothers in the fields and the buzz of silage season is soon to be upon us, we see our farming counterparts in Ukraine dealing with the realities of war.  What were cornfields are now, in many instances, battlefields.  While we must be cognisant of the awful reality facing the people of Ukraine, our focus is also on attempting to protect our farm families in Ireland from the worst effects of the impacts of the war.  Supply chains have been disrupted and inputs have been extremely volatile. As a Government and as a people, we remain resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine.  We reiterate the call on Russia to cease all hostilities immediately and withdraw from Ukraine unconditionally.  I welcome the strong solidarity shown by Ireland and our people and by the European Union with Ukraine in the face of its illegal invasion.  We will work with EU partners to consider and implement appropriate responses.  This includes ensuring that food security is maintained for EU citizens and the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context. While Ireland has recently come out first in the world on the Economist Impact global food security index, and the European Union is largely self-sufficient for food with a massive agrifood trade surplus, it is important that we do not become complacent about food security. We also need to keep in mind those who are living in countries that are many times less for­ tunate than ours.  Ireland is providing some €20 million in humanitarian assistance to the UN and the Red Cross to deliver life-saving humanitarian assistance in Ukraine and neighbouring countries.  My Department also provides flexible funding of €25 million per year to the UN World Food Programme, supporting that organisation to provide a flexible, timely response to humanitarian crises. Millions of people have now fled Ukraine to seek refuge in the EU.  We have operated an open-door policy to support any Ukrainians fleeing to here and this will continue to be the case. In my Department, and through the State agencies that report to me, we have played a leader­ ship role.  More than 50 Ukrainians have been welcomed by Teagasc at Ballyhaise College in County Cavan and a further 35 have been welcomed in Clonakilty Agricultural College in County Cork.  I thank both colleges for their efforts. Looking more specifically at both my own and this Government’s response to this crisis, as I said earlier, our clear focus is on insulating our farm families as much as possible from the trade shock suffered as a result of the war and on supporting them in being able to continue to produce the food that is so important domestically and internationally at this time.  Since the invasion of Ukraine, I have taken a proactive approach to dealing with the massive challenges facing our agrifood and fish sectors.  Obviously, farming is not alone in dealing with these chal­ lenges but our great sector is particularly exposed as a result of the invasion, and we are work­ ing hard to support farm families through this situation. I have operated a twin-track approach to the crisis with advisory measures and targeted financial supports for farm families.  In early March, shortly after the invasion occurred, I met the main farm organisations and Teagasc to discuss the impact on Irish agriculture and supply chains.  I also met members of the Irish Grain and Feed Association and representatives of the fertiliser industry.  I established the National Fodder and Food Security Committee and tasked it with the preparation of a response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs and with developing contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.  I will continue to engage closely with the sector as we work together on this significant challenge. Within my Department, I have also established a rapid response team, chaired by the Sec­ retary General, to monitor the impacts on agri-food supply chains actively and to contribute to the whole-of-government response to the crisis.  Over the past two months, I have announced targeted measures worth in the region of €90 million to support the agriculture sector directly, including a €20 million package in two separate parts for the pig sector.  These two separate supports will see €90,000 paid to farmers.  There will also be €12 million for the growing of new tillage crops as well as multispecies swards and red clover, both of which will help reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser.  Furthermore, there will be €3 million for the horticul­ ture sector, a very important domestic market we need to protect.  I was glad to work with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in delivering this.  These measures will help Irish farmers at a time of escalating costs and build resilience against the expected impact of the events in Ukraine.  I thank my Cabinet colleagues, and in particular the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, for helping to deliver these important supports.  They are real and tangible examples of the Government’s commitment to the agri and farming sectors. As Deputies will be aware, Ireland imports significant volumes of animal feedstuffs, in­ cluding feed from Ukraine, Russia and Belarus.  Russia and Ukraine are significant sources of global cereal exports, so the price and the availability of cereals globally have been significantly impacted.  As of today, there appear to be sufficient supplies of animal feed and Irish importers are actively competing in the global market to ensure the supply will continue uninterrupted. Fodder availability on farms for next winter depends on several factors, particularly the level of grass growth and silage production this year, but there appears to be a decent bank of silage on farms carried over from the winter. Nevertheless, it is crucial we do not stand still and expect this to be the case over the coming winter and into the spring.  To that end, I am developing a measure to assist cattle and sheep farmers in producing fodder for next winter and I will shortly release further details on a scheme that will pay farmers up to €1,000 to save hay and silage.  It will be paid at a rate of €100 on the first 10 ha, up to €1,000 per farm.  My key message to farmers concerns the absolute importance of growing grass this year, saving fodder and hay and making use of the growing season that is ahead of us to do that, and I have committed strongly to them that they will be supported in the form of up to €1,000.  I am conscious the war in Ukraine has seen issues with both the afford­ ability and the availability of fertiliser and that this could result in challenges for next winter, which is why I have moved to introduce the scheme.  While most cattle and sheep are now out on grass, I am conscious the winter season is just finishing for some.  We must think prudently when it comes to silage and grain to ensure we will have more than enough to cover the level of stock on an individual farm.  In essence, what farmers plan to breed they must also plan to feed. Even before the war in Ukraine, I was conscious of the rising price of fertiliser and of the overall need to reduce our dependency on chemical fertiliser.  Accordingly, last October, I tasked Teagasc with developing a roadmap to aid our transition away from using artificial fertilisers. I subsequently launched the Teagasc soils, nutrients and fertiliser campaign, a credible plan farmers are already using that will be good both for the environment and for farmers’ pockets and bottom lines.  As we know, Russia accounts for 22% of our fertiliser, so we have to plan in the short and long terms in light of that.  Fertiliser merchants have indicated they are confident they will be able to meet the demand for fertiliser, although there are a number of challenges in sourcing product at the moment.  There may be issues with the availability of certain products at times and importers are active in securing alternative supply lines where necessary.  All farmers are encouraged to review their requirements in order that they can secure fertiliser supply if that is not already in place, and it is important all farms put in place a nutrient management plan to set their farms to grow the grass required for the winter and spring ahead.  Advisers will assist farmers with this plan.  A Teagasc survey found most tillage and dairy farmers have secured their fertiliser requirements for the moment, while dry stock farmers, many of whom plan on spreading less fertiliser on grazing ground, are finding it more difficult to secure their fertiliser requirements.  Almost half of all dry stock farmers who were surveyed two to three weeks ago had yet to spread a chemical fertiliser, a concern that has led me to bring forward the €1,000 scheme to incentivise farmers to save hay and silage. I am also aware of the issues relating to horticulture and have engaged, along with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, with the sector.  Energy is a significant input for many horticultural enterprises, given crops such as tomatoes, cucumbers and mushrooms are grown indoors in glasshouses and protected greenhouse structures.  I am glad to have been able to bring forward a €3 million support package for the sector, working closely with the Minister of State, which will assist high-wire and mushroom growers as well as field-vegetable and apple farmers.  Further details on this support package will be made known shortly. Overall, our sector is one that relies on fuel of various types, from road, agricultural and marine diesel to natural gas.  The year 2020 saw fuel prices at their lowest in a decade, while 2021 and this year have seen fuel prices increase to their highest in a decade.  This is adding a significant additional cost to farmers, processors, road hauliers and the fishing industry.  For many farmers, energy costs have increased by between 80% and 100% in the past year.  While we cannot cover all aspects of the input price increases, we have to take a proactive and rapid step to insulate farm families as best as possible, and that is certainly the approach we have been taking.  I again mention the pig sector and the challenging circumstances it continues to face, which both the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and I are monitoring closely.  Bringing forward that package to the tune of a maximum of €90,000 per farm has been crucial in sup­ porting the sector at this time, and I recognise the work of that Minister of State in sharing the round table on the sector over recent months and working with stakeholders.  We will continue to work to support the sector and to finalise the scheme, which we will launch shortly. The seafood sector has been impacted especially hard by the crisis.  The price of marine fuel remains a matter of concern for our fishing fleet and the broader seafood sector.  This is the most recent crisis to hit our seafood sector in recent years and those crises are having a cumulative impact.  The Government is acutely aware of the impact rising prices are having on businesses throughout the country, but while the European Commission has provided additional flexibility regarding the use of funds under the EU fisheries fund in the context of the fuel crisis, additional funds have not been made available by the EU.  The impacts of Brexit and the trade and co- operation agreement also continue to be a significant concern for our seafood sector and coastal communities.  That is why in recent days, I launched the tie-up scheme, providing for two tie-up opportunities of three months’ duration each.  This will mean boats will have an opportunity to tie up for one month in three and will be paid over the course of that month on an equivalent basis to what their income would have been over that time.  As a result, the remaining two thirds of boats that are fishing in a given month will have a 50% higher quota to fish.  Moreover, it will help improve the margins for the boats that fish in those months, while the other one third of boats will be able to avail of the tie-up scheme at the same time.  The scheme will run in two three-month tranches and will be a strong support for fishermen at what is a challenging time for them. Earlier today, I was glad to be able to announce a €45 million investment in our seafood processing sector.  This, too, is a crucial part of our sector, responsible for more than 4,000 jobs nationally.  While I continue to fight at every opportunity at European level to improve our situation with regard to the national quota, it is crucial we maximise the value of the fish we are catching and the quota we have, and that the value of every fish that is landed will be maximised both for fishers and coastal communities and for employment.  The €45 million sum is an unprecedented investment in our processing sector that is targeted at adding value to the fish we catch in order that we will maximise the value of the fish that is landed and extract the maximum value and income.  Of course, alongside that, as has been the case throughout my tenure as Minister, I will fight tooth and nail at European level, not least in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy review, to seek every way to improve our opportunities regarding our overall national quota.  Since the publication of the report of the seafood task force, Navigating Change, my Department has been working across the board to examine urgently its recom­ mendations.  We have also brought forward a number of schemes over recent months.  The seafood sector is undoubtedly facing one of the most significant challenges in decades, coming immediately after the challenges posed by the pandemic and Brexit.  I will continue to work very closely with the sector to support it. As I said at the beginning, our great agriculture sector is facing some of its most significant challenges, as is our marine sector.  Many of these are challenges we have not seen before.  In times like these, it is crucial that we take a proactive approach and that we take steps to limit any potential disruption to our feed and supply chains.  I know that farmers, fishers and the agrifood sector will rise to these challenges and meet them head on.  By working collectively and col­ laboratively, we can ensure that the sector is insulated against the worst of what may come from supply chain disruption but the coming weeks and months will undoubtedly be challenging.  I want the House to know that I stand in full support of our farmers and fishers, their families and their businesses throughout this period of historic upheaval.  The road ahead will be challenging but we will get through it because it is in our DNA to persevere and flourish in times of adver­ sity.  There are businesses and consumers across the globe who rely on our amazing produce as a source of safe, sustainable and healthy food.  These are our calling cards and what makes our agrifood and fisheries sector the world-class industries they are today.",

  "Exact Text": "'climate action plan' I thank Deputy Paul Murphy for his question.  As he will be aware, the Government will soon establish and publish our sectoral emission ceilings.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 set out a reduction range of between 22% and 30% for the agricul­ tural sector from an emissions baseline of 23 MT CO2 equivalent in 2018.  The achievement of this target will take a whole-of-government and whole-of-sector approach.  I am committed to working with the sector on achieving emissions reductions. Earlier this year, I established the Food Vision Dairy 2030 group.  The objective of this group is to propose measures that will reduce emissions in the dairy sector.  The group is cur­ rently working on the final report, having submitted an interim report to me a number of weeks ago.  A similar group was more recently established for the beef and sheepmeat sectors focused on the climate challenges facing these important sectors. These groups were not starting with a blank page.  We have a roadmap for the sector to reduce emissions over the course of the decade.  The climate action plan set out a number of core measures that the sector will need to implement over the coming years.  These measures include a significant reduction in chemical nitrogen fertiliser use, which is a key objective of the EU farm to fork strategy.  Other important measures include changing the type of fertiliser N we apply, increasing the level of organic farming and reducing the finishing ages of our prime beef animals. The Teagasc signpost farms initiative, along with many public and private advisors, will play a key role in upskilling farmers in the years ahead.  The new CAP strategic plan contains a number of measures that will support a transition to a more sustainable agriculture sector, in­ cluding increased financial supports for organic farming.  Clearly, incentivisation from industry, in addition to regulation where appropriate, will be acquired to achieve our climate objectives. By implementing the measures contained within the climate action plan, I am confident that we can transition the sector to a more long-term sustainable platform with co-benefits for air and water quality and biodiversity, while at all times maintaining productivity in this sector.

  "Exact Text": "I wel­ come the opportunity to contribute on the 2024 agriculture, food and marine budget introduced by me and my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon. My goal for budget 2024 was to support our farm and fishing families.  This has been achieved with vital livestock schemes secured, environmental schemes bolstered in funding, new infrastructure measures introduced to support farmers impacted by the changes to the ni­ trates derogation and support provided for the development of our fishing sector and coastal communities.  This is in addition to rolling out the largest ever Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan amounting to €10 billion. A total of €1.942 billion has been allocated to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Ma­ rine for coming year.  It is important that I clarify the difficult budgetary constraint under which this was achieved.  This 2024 figure adjusts to reflect the discontinuation of more than €240 million in Brexit Adjustment Reserve, BAR, funding, as the deadline for all expenditure under that fund is December of this year.  While this BAR funding was predominantly expended in the fisheries sector, in 2023 it also supported the genotyping programme for our livestock herd and the national beef welfare scheme for which I have now secured national funding to continue. Budget 2024 demonstrates my unwavering commitment to our beef and sheep farmers.  I have provided targeted supports of more than €118 million for the livestock sectors.  I will continue to provide the €200 per cow payment delivered for our beef suckler cows and calves in 2023.  I intend to provide an additional payment for sheep farmers which, together with the current sheep welfare scheme payments, will result in a payment equivalent to €20 per ewe in 2024.  This will be the highest payment ever provided to our vital sheep sector.  Beef and sheep farmers will also be well placed to benefit from the enhanced supports for environmental mea­ sures and the supports available for farmers transitioning to organic farming.  My officials are currently working through the details of what is possible with this funding and further details will be announced in due course. The budget will result in more than €700 million spent in support of farm families in their efforts to tackle the challenges of climate, biodiversity and water quality in 2024.  The changes to the nitrates derogation have been the cause of much concern to farmers across the country. I have promised to support farmers in this transition and this budget will finance the first step in ensuring that our derogation is protected in the next review.  Improving water quality is piv­ otal to achieving this aim.  To support farmers in their efforts to improve water quality through investment in on-farm nutrient storage, a number of new targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS 3, measures are being introduced.  My first action will be to engage with the European Commission to secure changes to the TAMS 3 investment aid scheme to allow the introduction of a separate investment ceiling for all farmers building additional storage facili­ ties on farm, beyond regulatory compliance.  This support will be available to all farmers at the prevailing rates of 40% and 60%, the higher rate being available to young farmers and female farmers. In addition, and in support of water quality and efficient nutrient use, I will also seek ap­ proval to introduce a dedicated support measure to provide 70% support for manure storage facilities on farms importing livestock manure under a contract relationship.  To further assist farmers in this space, funding to support the hugely successful soil sampling scheme and the multispecies sward schemes is continued. I have increased the allocation for the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, by €40 million bringing the total scheme allocation to €200 million.  The level of interest in ACRES has demonstrated that farmers are clearly making a positive contribution in addressing a range of climate, biodiversity and environmental issues.  After the unprecedented demand for places in tranche 1 of ACRES, I am delighted to announce that tranche 2 of the scheme will open for applications in the coming weeks.  This will allow us to deliver on the Government’s commitment to have 50,000 farmers participating in the flagship environmental scheme. Building on the additional measures, I have introduced in support of the tillage sector in recent years including increased support for protein aid, the introduction of the straw incor­ poration measure and the provision of a tillage incentive scheme under the Ukraine response framework, I am making €8 million available to support this important sector next year.  This demonstrates my commitment to the sector and my support for the work of the Food Vision tillage group. Over the lifetime of this Government, €500 million has been spent on the seafood sector. Over the past two years I have announced a range of schemes, worth €271 million, designed to support the seafood sector and coastal communities in overcoming the impact of Brexit. In December 2022, the European Commission adopted the Seafood Development Programme 2021-2027.  The funding provision made by the Government in budget 2024 will enable this programme to provide further support to the sector over the coming years.  The programme will ensure that the seafood sector will not only survive but generate economic growth and sustain jobs.  The programme will also provide funding to State bodies that carry out important work in the marine environment to protect our coastal natural resources. The programme measures, supported by the budget, will include capital investment on board vessels, marine environmental requirements, control work and investments in aquaculture, as well as support for young fishers, processors and the inshore sector, and a completion of the largest ever investment into our piers and harbours in the State. Regarding agri-taxation measures, we have a taxation policy that supports the transfer of land to the next generation of farmers and the Government is committed to protecting this at all costs.  The agri-taxation measures announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Dep­ uty Michael McGrath, will be key drivers of agriculture policy next year and will be of direct benefit to Irish farm families.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy McGrath, to defer the residential zoned land tax, RZLT, by one year to February 2025.  While the RZLT is an important part of the Government’s commitment to increase and promote home building, genuine farmers who wished to continue farming their land were impacted.  Having this issue rectified was an important request of mine for this budget.  This deferral will allow for another annual mapping cycle to take place before landowners become subject to the tax and, therefore, allow a further period during which landowners and farmers can engage in the process and make a rezoning request to their local authority. I also welcome that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has agreed to my proposal to restrict long-term leasing relief so that it does not become immediately available to the purchasers of land.  This will see the relief only become available when land had been owned for seven years which focuses the relief on genuine farmers, reduces the likelihood of speculation while protecting the support for farmers engaged in long-term lease arrangements.  Further to this, the renewal of stamp duty consanguinity relief on transfers of farmland and the continuation of accelerated capital allowances for slurry storage for another two years is welcome. These taxation supports align very closely with my Department’s policies in support of farmers to improve their environmental sustainability, generational renewal and farm safety. The renewal of the consanguinity relief for an additional five years promotes and encourages the lifetime transfer of farms, thereby enhancing generational renewal in the sector. I am very much aware of the challenges facing farm families.  The farm, food and fishing sectors are the lifeblood of rural and coastal communities and contribute enormously to pros­ perity and employment creation right across the economy.  I am satisfied that this budget con­ tinues to support these vital sectors.  I am working closely with the Ministers of State, Deputy Heydon and Senator Hackett, who will now give further detail on the budgetary measures in their specific areas of responsibility.  Over the year ahead, we will continue to support our farm families and fishing communities in every way we can. Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine(Senator Pippa Hackett): This is a budget focused on the environment, both in the Department of Ag­ riculture, Food and the Marine and across Government.  Since this Government took office in 2020 we have made huge strides in the organic sector.  I am further backing this with funding of €57 million for organic farmers in 2024, which is more than 50% higher than the provision for organic farming in last year’s budget.  Since entering Government we have doubled the number of organic farmers and doubled the land area farmed organically.  We are on track to hit our target to have 10% of Irish farmland under organic production by 2030.  This is real money making a real difference to farm families, funding real change in the way we farm and in our environment.  I will reopen the organic farming scheme to new applicants very shortly.  Again, we will see the massive interest in this sector, showing that farmers want to produce food in a nature-friendly way and that Government will back them all the way.  This Government is backing farmers, backing the environment and backing rural Ireland.  Unlike the Opposition parties which, judging by their budget day contributions in this House yesterday, either do not understand or do not care, and failed to acknowledge farming and the significant role this sec­ tor can play in enhancing our environment and in rural Ireland.  Sinn Féin managed a fleeting, token reference to farmers.  There was not one word from the Social Democrats or the Labour Party on the issue. Farmers the length and breadth of Ireland are playing their part in the green transition and the Government too is playing its part.  The new forestry programme is the most ambitious in the history of the State.  We are paying farmers more than €2,000 per hectare, tax free, every year for ten years to plant native woodlands of up to a hectare on their farms, without the need for a licence.  We are backing farmers and foresters to be at the heart of our efforts to reduce emis­ sions and improve biodiversity and water quality.  We are paying 20 years of tax-free premiums to farmers, securing their future and that of their families.  Again, this is real money, making a real difference to farm families, funding real change in how we farm and in our environment. The horticulture industry is another vital part of our farming sector.  We are backing grow­ ers with funding of more than €14.35 million for the year ahead.  We will use this funding to support capital investment in the horticulture industry to deliver the national strategy for horti­ culture and to provide advanced payments to producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector. European innovation partnerships, EIPs, as they are fondly known, have been another huge area of success during this Government’s term.  Locally-led results-based schemes are a win- win delivering for farm family incomes and for the environment.  This is why I fought hard for the locally-led results-based model to form a key part of our cap strategic plan through the agri-climate rural environmental scheme, ACRES, co-operation projects.  On top of the €200 million ACRES funding to benefit farmers in  cooperation projects throughout the country next year, we will spend an additional €18 million in 2024 on new EIPs.  This strong financial back­ ing will support farmers to take targeted action at a local level to improve water quality on dairy farms, to protect and enhance habitats for breeding waders, to carry out trials on peatland farms and to support new EIPs under a call under project proposals early next year.  Yet again, this is real money making a real difference to farm families, funding real change in how we farm and in our environment. Soil health is vital for our very existence.  The more we know about it the better informed we are to make the decisions necessary to preserve and regenerate our soils.  We are putting nearly €9 million into the soil sampling and analysis programme in 2024.  This will enable farmers to take informed targeted decisions at field level and ultimately reduce their reliance on chemical inputs, saving farmers real money and making a real difference to the environment. Organic farmers have been sowing multi-species swards for generations and now it is go­ ing mainstream.  Multi-species swards reduce emissions, they benefit nature and save farmers money.  The Government is putting €2.5 million into multi-species swards in 2024.  Again, it is real money benefiting farmers and making a real difference to the environment. We have heard a lot of spin over the past two days from those in opposition.  They are desperate to criticise a budget that is good for families, good for businesses and good for the environment.  There is no doubt that budget day is an important milestone for any sector but announcing and allocating funding is only one piece of the jigsaw.  We have a responsibility to use taxpayers’ money in a strategically-focused way to bring about the long-term outcomes that we want to see.  That is why we are taking long-term, targeted, strategic action to protect fu­ ture generations both through the infrastructure climate and nature fund and through the future Ireland fund.  These are decisions we are taking today to benefit tomorrow.  Similarly, under my own remit, we are planning today to bring about the tomorrow we want to see.  We have a national strategy for horticulture out to 2027.  In regard to forestry, I published Ireland’s forest strategy earlier this month out to 2030.  The organic sector is working to build on the momen­ tum that has begun.  We are working with the sector on an updated national organic strategy which should be published early next year. This is all in the wider context of a climate action plan that goes to the core of what this Government is about, namely, being the greenest Government in the history of the State.  We demonstrated that in the programme for Government.  We demonstrated it in the last three budgets and we have demonstrated it again this year.  We will continue to demonstrate it as we continue on our transition to a greener, cleaner future for Ireland. Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Martin Heydon): Budget 2024 is an opportunity for this Government to ensure that we deliver for farmers and for rural Ireland.  In my own areas of responsibility, I have put a particular focus on addressing the three legs of the sustainability stool, namely, economic, environmental and social.  I will continue to build the networks to improve farmer safety, health and well-being with a dedicated fund of €2.5 million in 2024.  This fund will be used to extend the range of initiatives currently undertaken to improve farm safety and wellness among the farming com­ munity.  This dedicated funding has allowed me to target key areas such as the quality of safety training in our agricultural colleges, to roll out targeted programmes to primary school children and to get physical investments onto farms through the national farm safety measures, where we are nearing 4,000 expressions of interest.  That is 4,000 farms that will now have quad helmets or will have defective PTO covers replaced.  I have also funded a range of awareness- raising initiatives around key risks such as calving season, quad bike use as well as investing in health supports for farmers. Social sustainability encompasses a wide range of areas including farm succession, farm safety, farmer health and well-being, and over the next year, I intend to target a number of these areas further through initiatives in my farm safety budget.  The budget for farm safety also complements the intense work I have been doing to put farm safety at the heart of everything we do.  In the previous CAP, there was a requirement to complete half-day farm safety train­ ing under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  Now, we have a dedicated farm safety heading as part of the scheme with a higher 60% grant rate to provide every farmer with the opportunity to invest in their farm’s safety and efficiency.  It is therefore welcome that budget 2024 has earmarked a significant provision for TAMS. On the tax side, we are extending several reliefs designed to help with farm succession and extending the accelerated capital allowance for farm safety equipment and investment.  This is something I fought to have introduced a number of years ago.  These support farmers who have suffered life-changing injuries and want to continue farming into the future.  Very importantly, they also support investments in preventative measures that make farms safer. We are also providing additional places on the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES.  Every farmer in the scheme will be provided with farm safety training as part of the programme, ensuring we reach an even broader cohort of farmers.  These courses are getting under way around the country as we speak. Livestock is one of the major risks on farms, as we know.  In addition to providing more than €100 million in financial supports for beef and sheep farmers, our new beef scheme, the suckler carbon efficiency programme, SCEP, also makes provision for providing safety training to farmers who often handle high-risk animals.  Of course, farm succession is closely linked to farm safety and the Government has again reaffirmed its commitment to the present and future generations by extending tax reliefs and increasing individual thresholds. The area of research and development is also a key focus for me.  I am delighted to have secured an additional €2 million in funding for this area, bringing my Department’s research budget to €22.45 million.  This will be used to drive greater innovation in our agriculture, food, forestry and bio-economy sectors as we position Irish agriculture as a leader in sustain­ able food production.  Farmers cannot deliver on environmental sustainability unless they are economically sustainable.  I firmly believe the answer to the challenges faced by agriculture around climate and environmental issues lies in science and innovation.  Agriculture reduced its emissions last year and we are on a downward trajectory.  Also, research work funded by the Department has led to significant breakthroughs in areas such as low-nitrogen grasses and selecting for low-emitting livestock.  We are also seeing some positive results in the work we have funded on methane additives, and we will share those shortly. All these breakthroughs strengthen farmers’ toolboxes to allow them to continue producing top-quality food while doing so with a reduced emission profile.  This will be a key driver of increasing the value of our food and drink exports in the years ahead.  Budget 2024 allows us to maintain this momentum, ensuring we have the resources for strong funding calls to build on existing partnerships with countries such as New Zealand, and not only address challenges we face here but also to be leaders in global efforts to develop sustainable livestock systems. We must also showcase to farmers and the wider public what these efforts are translating to in the real world.  We need widespread adoption of the latest technology and management practices.  That is why we are organising a major agri-climate conference that will take place on 15 November in the Aviva Stadium.  Teagasc, too, plays a crucial role in driving innovation on farms and to ensure the adoption and uptake of new practices we are making an allocation of just under €168 million to Teagasc as part of budget 2024, which is an increase of 3% on last year. Finally, reducing the emissions profile of our food production and ensuring we are market leaders in sustainable food production are central to everything we want to achieve under Food Vision 2030.  Currently, we are in the lead but if we stand still, others will catch up.  Bord Bia will receive an allocation of just under €57 million, which is also a 3% increase.  It plays an important role in marketing Irish food abroad and ensuring we are alive to the trends in the markets we are currently in, as well as identifying those newer markets that have high potential. In the year ahead, we will continue to focus on improving our market access across a range of priority markets, in addition to building on the very valuable existing markets we have.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I wel­ come the opportunity to contribute on the 2024 agriculture, food and marine budget introduced by me and my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Senator Hackett and Deputy Heydon. My goal for budget 2024 was to support our farm and fishing families.  This has been achieved with vital livestock schemes secured, environmental schemes bolstered in funding, new infrastructure measures introduced to support farmers impacted by the changes to the ni­ trates derogation and support provided for the development of our fishing sector and coastal communities.  This is in addition to rolling out the largest ever Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan amounting to €10 billion. A total of €1.942 billion has been allocated to the Department of Agriculture, Food and Ma­ rine for coming year.  It is important that I clarify the difficult budgetary constraint under which this was achieved.  This 2024 figure adjusts to reflect the discontinuation of more than €240 million in Brexit Adjustment Reserve, BAR, funding, as the deadline for all expenditure under that fund is December of this year.  While this BAR funding was predominantly expended in the fisheries sector, in 2023 it also supported the genotyping programme for our livestock herd and the national beef welfare scheme for which I have now secured national funding to continue. Budget 2024 demonstrates my unwavering commitment to our beef and sheep farmers.  I have provided targeted supports of more than €118 million for the livestock sectors.  I will continue to provide the €200 per cow payment delivered for our beef suckler cows and calves in 2023.  I intend to provide an additional payment for sheep farmers which, together with the current sheep welfare scheme payments, will result in a payment equivalent to €20 per ewe in 2024.  This will be the highest payment ever provided to our vital sheep sector.  Beef and sheep farmers will also be well placed to benefit from the enhanced supports for environmental mea­ sures and the supports available for farmers transitioning to organic farming.  My officials are currently working through the details of what is possible with this funding and further details will be announced in due course. The budget will result in more than €700 million spent in support of farm families in their efforts to tackle the challenges of climate, biodiversity and water quality in 2024.  The changes to the nitrates derogation have been the cause of much concern to farmers across the country. I have promised to support farmers in this transition and this budget will finance the first step in ensuring that our derogation is protected in the next review.  Improving water quality is piv­ otal to achieving this aim.  To support farmers in their efforts to improve water quality through investment in on-farm nutrient storage, a number of new targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS 3, measures are being introduced.  My first action will be to engage with the European Commission to secure changes to the TAMS 3 investment aid scheme to allow the introduction of a separate investment ceiling for all farmers building additional storage facili­ ties on farm, beyond regulatory compliance.  This support will be available to all farmers at the prevailing rates of 40% and 60%, the higher rate being available to young farmers and female farmers. In addition, and in support of water quality and efficient nutrient use, I will also seek ap­ proval to introduce a dedicated support measure to provide 70% support for manure storage facilities on farms importing livestock manure under a contract relationship.  To further assist farmers in this space, funding to support the hugely successful soil sampling scheme and the multispecies sward schemes is continued. I have increased the allocation for the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, by €40 million bringing the total scheme allocation to €200 million.  The level of interest in ACRES has demonstrated that farmers are clearly making a positive contribution in addressing a range of climate, biodiversity and environmental issues.  After the unprecedented demand for places in tranche 1 of ACRES, I am delighted to announce that tranche 2 of the scheme will open for applications in the coming weeks.  This will allow us to deliver on the Government’s commitment to have 50,000 farmers participating in the flagship environmental scheme. Building on the additional measures, I have introduced in support of the tillage sector in recent years including increased support for protein aid, the introduction of the straw incor­ poration measure and the provision of a tillage incentive scheme under the Ukraine response framework, I am making €8 million available to support this important sector next year.  This demonstrates my commitment to the sector and my support for the work of the Food Vision tillage group. Over the lifetime of this Government, €500 million has been spent on the seafood sector. Over the past two years I have announced a range of schemes, worth €271 million, designed to support the seafood sector and coastal communities in overcoming the impact of Brexit. In December 2022, the European Commission adopted the Seafood Development Programme 2021-2027.  The funding provision made by the Government in budget 2024 will enable this programme to provide further support to the sector over the coming years.  The programme will ensure that the seafood sector will not only survive but generate economic growth and sustain jobs.  The programme will also provide funding to State bodies that carry out important work in the marine environment to protect our coastal natural resources. The programme measures, supported by the budget, will include capital investment on board vessels, marine environmental requirements, control work and investments in aquaculture, as well as support for young fishers, processors and the inshore sector, and a completion of the largest ever investment into our piers and harbours in the State. Regarding agri-taxation measures, we have a taxation policy that supports the transfer of land to the next generation of farmers and the Government is committed to protecting this at all costs.  The agri-taxation measures announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Dep­ uty Michael McGrath, will be key drivers of agriculture policy next year and will be of direct benefit to Irish farm families.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy McGrath, to defer the residential zoned land tax, RZLT, by one year to February 2025.  While the RZLT is an important part of the Government’s commitment to increase and promote home building, genuine farmers who wished to continue farming their land were impacted.  Having this issue rectified was an important request of mine for this budget.  This deferral will allow for another annual mapping cycle to take place before landowners become subject to the tax and, therefore, allow a further period during which landowners and farmers can engage in the process and make a rezoning request to their local authority. I also welcome that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, has agreed to my proposal to restrict long-term leasing relief so that it does not become immediately available to the purchasers of land.  This will see the relief only become available when land had been owned for seven years which focuses the relief on genuine farmers, reduces the likelihood of speculation while protecting the support for farmers engaged in long-term lease arrangements.  Further to this, the renewal of stamp duty consanguinity relief on transfers of farmland and the continuation of accelerated capital allowances for slurry storage for another two years is welcome. These taxation supports align very closely with my Department’s policies in support of farmers to improve their environmental sustainability, generational renewal and farm safety. The renewal of the consanguinity relief for an additional five years promotes and encourages the lifetime transfer of farms, thereby enhancing generational renewal in the sector. I am very much aware of the challenges facing farm families.  The farm, food and fishing sectors are the lifeblood of rural and coastal communities and contribute enormously to pros­ perity and employment creation right across the economy.  I am satisfied that this budget con­ tinues to support these vital sectors.  I am working closely with the Ministers of State, Deputy Heydon and Senator Hackett, who will now give further detail on the budgetary measures in their specific areas of responsibility.  Over the year ahead, we will continue to support our farm families and fishing communities in every way we can. Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine(Senator Pippa Hackett): This is a budget focused on the environment, both in the Department of Ag­ riculture, Food and the Marine and across Government.  Since this Government took office in 2020 we have made huge strides in the organic sector.  I am further backing this with funding of €57 million for organic farmers in 2024, which is more than 50% higher than the provision for organic farming in last year’s budget.  Since entering Government we have doubled the number of organic farmers and doubled the land area farmed organically.  We are on track to hit our target to have 10% of Irish farmland under organic production by 2030.  This is real money making a real difference to farm families, funding real change in the way we farm and in our environment.  I will reopen the organic farming scheme to new applicants very shortly.  Again, we will see the massive interest in this sector, showing that farmers want to produce food in a nature-friendly way and that Government will back them all the way.  This Government is backing farmers, backing the environment and backing rural Ireland.  Unlike the Opposition parties which, judging by their budget day contributions in this House yesterday, either do not understand or do not care, and failed to acknowledge farming and the significant role this sec­ tor can play in enhancing our environment and in rural Ireland.  Sinn Féin managed a fleeting, token reference to farmers.  There was not one word from the Social Democrats or the Labour Party on the issue. Farmers the length and breadth of Ireland are playing their part in the green transition and the Government too is playing its part.  The new forestry programme is the most ambitious in the history of the State.  We are paying farmers more than €2,000 per hectare, tax free, every year for ten years to plant native woodlands of up to a hectare on their farms, without the need for a licence.  We are backing farmers and foresters to be at the heart of our efforts to reduce emis­ sions and improve biodiversity and water quality.  We are paying 20 years of tax-free premiums to farmers, securing their future and that of their families.  Again, this is real money, making a real difference to farm families, funding real change in how we farm and in our environment. The horticulture industry is another vital part of our farming sector.  We are backing grow­ ers with funding of more than €14.35 million for the year ahead.  We will use this funding to support capital investment in the horticulture industry to deliver the national strategy for horti­ culture and to provide advanced payments to producer organisations in the fruit and vegetable sector. European innovation partnerships, EIPs, as they are fondly known, have been another huge area of success during this Government’s term.  Locally-led results-based schemes are a win- win delivering for farm family incomes and for the environment.  This is why I fought hard for the locally-led results-based model to form a key part of our cap strategic plan through the agri-climate rural environmental scheme, ACRES, co-operation projects.  On top of the €200 million ACRES funding to benefit farmers in  cooperation projects throughout the country next year, we will spend an additional €18 million in 2024 on new EIPs.  This strong financial back­ ing will support farmers to take targeted action at a local level to improve water quality on dairy farms, to protect and enhance habitats for breeding waders, to carry out trials on peatland farms and to support new EIPs under a call under project proposals early next year.  Yet again, this is real money making a real difference to farm families, funding real change in how we farm and in our environment. Soil health is vital for our very existence.  The more we know about it the better informed we are to make the decisions necessary to preserve and regenerate our soils.  We are putting nearly €9 million into the soil sampling and analysis programme in 2024.  This will enable farmers to take informed targeted decisions at field level and ultimately reduce their reliance on chemical inputs, saving farmers real money and making a real difference to the environment. Organic farmers have been sowing multi-species swards for generations and now it is go­ ing mainstream.  Multi-species swards reduce emissions, they benefit nature and save farmers money.  The Government is putting €2.5 million into multi-species swards in 2024.  Again, it is real money benefiting farmers and making a real difference to the environment. We have heard a lot of spin over the past two days from those in opposition.  They are desperate to criticise a budget that is good for families, good for businesses and good for the environment.  There is no doubt that budget day is an important milestone for any sector but announcing and allocating funding is only one piece of the jigsaw.  We have a responsibility to use taxpayers’ money in a strategically-focused way to bring about the long-term outcomes that we want to see.  That is why we are taking long-term, targeted, strategic action to protect fu­ ture generations both through the infrastructure climate and nature fund and through the future Ireland fund.  These are decisions we are taking today to benefit tomorrow.  Similarly, under my own remit, we are planning today to bring about the tomorrow we want to see.  We have a national strategy for horticulture out to 2027.  In regard to forestry, I published Ireland’s forest strategy earlier this month out to 2030.  The organic sector is working to build on the momen­ tum that has begun.  We are working with the sector on an updated national organic strategy which should be published early next year. This is all in the wider context of a climate action plan that goes to the core of what this Government is about, namely, being the greenest Government in the history of the State.  We demonstrated that in the programme for Government.  We demonstrated it in the last three budgets and we have demonstrated it again this year.  We will continue to demonstrate it as we continue on our transition to a greener, cleaner future for Ireland. Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Martin Heydon): Budget 2024 is an opportunity for this Government to ensure that we deliver for farmers and for rural Ireland.  In my own areas of responsibility, I have put a particular focus on addressing the three legs of the sustainability stool, namely, economic, environmental and social.  I will continue to build the networks to improve farmer safety, health and well-being with a dedicated fund of €2.5 million in 2024.  This fund will be used to extend the range of initiatives currently undertaken to improve farm safety and wellness among the farming com­ munity.  This dedicated funding has allowed me to target key areas such as the quality of safety training in our agricultural colleges, to roll out targeted programmes to primary school children and to get physical investments onto farms through the national farm safety measures, where we are nearing 4,000 expressions of interest.  That is 4,000 farms that will now have quad helmets or will have defective PTO covers replaced.  I have also funded a range of awareness- raising initiatives around key risks such as calving season, quad bike use as well as investing in health supports for farmers. Social sustainability encompasses a wide range of areas including farm succession, farm safety, farmer health and well-being, and over the next year, I intend to target a number of these areas further through initiatives in my farm safety budget.  The budget for farm safety also complements the intense work I have been doing to put farm safety at the heart of everything we do.  In the previous CAP, there was a requirement to complete half-day farm safety train­ ing under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS.  Now, we have a dedicated farm safety heading as part of the scheme with a higher 60% grant rate to provide every farmer with the opportunity to invest in their farm’s safety and efficiency.  It is therefore welcome that budget 2024 has earmarked a significant provision for TAMS. On the tax side, we are extending several reliefs designed to help with farm succession and extending the accelerated capital allowance for farm safety equipment and investment.  This is something I fought to have introduced a number of years ago.  These support farmers who have suffered life-changing injuries and want to continue farming into the future.  Very importantly, they also support investments in preventative measures that make farms safer. We are also providing additional places on the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES.  Every farmer in the scheme will be provided with farm safety training as part of the programme, ensuring we reach an even broader cohort of farmers.  These courses are getting under way around the country as we speak. Livestock is one of the major risks on farms, as we know.  In addition to providing more than €100 million in financial supports for beef and sheep farmers, our new beef scheme, the suckler carbon efficiency programme, SCEP, also makes provision for providing safety training to farmers who often handle high-risk animals.  Of course, farm succession is closely linked to farm safety and the Government has again reaffirmed its commitment to the present and future generations by extending tax reliefs and increasing individual thresholds. The area of research and development is also a key focus for me.  I am delighted to have secured an additional €2 million in funding for this area, bringing my Department’s research budget to €22.45 million.  This will be used to drive greater innovation in our agriculture, food, forestry and bio-economy sectors as we position Irish agriculture as a leader in sustain­ able food production.  Farmers cannot deliver on environmental sustainability unless they are economically sustainable.  I firmly believe the answer to the challenges faced by agriculture around climate and environmental issues lies in science and innovation.  Agriculture reduced its emissions last year and we are on a downward trajectory.  Also, research work funded by the Department has led to significant breakthroughs in areas such as low-nitrogen grasses and selecting for low-emitting livestock.  We are also seeing some positive results in the work we have funded on methane additives, and we will share those shortly. All these breakthroughs strengthen farmers’ toolboxes to allow them to continue producing top-quality food while doing so with a reduced emission profile.  This will be a key driver of increasing the value of our food and drink exports in the years ahead.  Budget 2024 allows us to maintain this momentum, ensuring we have the resources for strong funding calls to build on existing partnerships with countries such as New Zealand, and not only address challenges we face here but also to be leaders in global efforts to develop sustainable livestock systems. We must also showcase to farmers and the wider public what these efforts are translating to in the real world.  We need widespread adoption of the latest technology and management practices.  That is why we are organising a major agri-climate conference that will take place on 15 November in the Aviva Stadium.  Teagasc, too, plays a crucial role in driving innovation on farms and to ensure the adoption and uptake of new practices we are making an allocation of just under €168 million to Teagasc as part of budget 2024, which is an increase of 3% on last year. Finally, reducing the emissions profile of our food production and ensuring we are market leaders in sustainable food production are central to everything we want to achieve under Food Vision 2030.  Currently, we are in the lead but if we stand still, others will catch up.  Bord Bia will receive an allocation of just under €57 million, which is also a 3% increase.  It plays an important role in marketing Irish food abroad and ensuring we are alive to the trends in the markets we are currently in, as well as identifying those newer markets that have high potential. In the year ahead, we will continue to focus on improving our market access across a range of priority markets, in addition to building on the very valuable existing markets we have.",

  "Exact Text": "'agriculture industry' Deputy Berry’s question is quite a topical one.  It is one that is coming up quite a bit at the moment and getting a lot of discussion as well.  He is right that it was covered in the Irish Farmers’ Journal last week and it has been raised at many of the meetings I have been having with farm organisations in recent weeks too. I want to be clear that no decision has been taken by the Government to proceed with such a scheme.  There has been no such Government decision, and no Exchequer funding provision is currently in place for such a scheme either.  I have repeatedly stated that no farmer will be forced to reduce livestock numbers as part of the climate action plan process.  I want to be very clear in saying the same thing here again this morning. I established the Food Vision beef and sheep group, as well as the Food Vision dairy group last year to advance the actions for the beef and sheep and also the dairy sectors identified in the Food Vision 2030 strategy, as well as taking into account requirements for the sector to contrib­ ute to achieving the targets set for agriculture emissions in the climate action plan. The first priority for both groups was to chart a pathway to achieving the legally binding tar­ get of a 25% reduction by 2030.  Both the beef and sheep as well as the dairy groups submitted reports to me at the end of last year, which have been published.  Those reports identified the measures that could contribute to reducing emissions.  Since the reports were published, I have stated that owing to the serious concern expressed by the farming organisations on the propos­ als for voluntary reduction schemes, which would have provided a payment for those who were in position to reduce their herd or exit beef farming entirely, that such schemes in relation to the beef and suckler sector are off the table.  Farming organisations said they were not in favour of it, and they were adamant on that.  I want to work in partnership with farmers.  I said: “Fair enough.  It is off the table.  That will not happen.” A key recommendation in relation to the Food Vision dairy group was to explore and take forward a voluntary reduction scheme for the dairy herd.  In contrast to the beef and sheep sector, the Food Vision dairy group containing the farm organisations recommended that we should explore the capacity for such a scheme to play a role.  At the moment, I am engaging and consulting further with the Food Vision dairy group as to what that might look like before I make any further decision on it.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "Deputy Berry’s question is quite a topical one.  It is one that is coming up quite a bit at the moment and getting a lot of discussion as well.  He is right that it was covered in the Irish Farmers’ Journal last week and it has been raised at many of the meetings I have been having with farm organisations in recent weeks too. I want to be clear that no decision has been taken by the Government to proceed with such a scheme.  There has been no such Government decision, and no Exchequer funding provision is currently in place for such a scheme either.  I have repeatedly stated that no farmer will be forced to reduce livestock numbers as part of the climate action plan process.  I want to be very clear in saying the same thing here again this morning. I established the Food Vision beef and sheep group, as well as the Food Vision dairy group last year to advance the actions for the beef and sheep and also the dairy sectors identified in the Food Vision 2030 strategy, as well as taking into account requirements for the sector to contrib­ ute to achieving the targets set for agriculture emissions in the climate action plan. The first priority for both groups was to chart a pathway to achieving the legally binding tar­ get of a 25% reduction by 2030.  Both the beef and sheep as well as the dairy groups submitted reports to me at the end of last year, which have been published.  Those reports identified the measures that could contribute to reducing emissions.  Since the reports were published, I have stated that owing to the serious concern expressed by the farming organisations on the propos­ als for voluntary reduction schemes, which would have provided a payment for those who were in position to reduce their herd or exit beef farming entirely, that such schemes in relation to the beef and suckler sector are off the table.  Farming organisations said they were not in favour of it, and they were adamant on that.  I want to work in partnership with farmers.  I said: “Fair enough.  It is off the table.  That will not happen.” A key recommendation in relation to the Food Vision dairy group was to explore and take forward a voluntary reduction scheme for the dairy herd.  In contrast to the beef and sheep sector, the Food Vision dairy group containing the farm organisations recommended that we should explore the capacity for such a scheme to play a role.  At the moment, I am engaging and consulting further with the Food Vision dairy group as to what that might look like before I make any further decision on it.",

That is something I am confident we will do, and that is the approach we have taken so far and will continue to take. Where I am with a potential dairy reduction scheme is that the dairy vision group, compris­ ing all stakeholders in the sector as well as farm representative organisations, has recommended that it should be explored.  I have come back to them to say they should come back to me further with what exactly they are talking about here, what it would look like, what exactly it is they are saying we should explore and what should it look like?  Once they come back with that, I will consider the matter further.  Again, we will be doing it very much by working closely with farm representatives and all stakeholders, but particularly important in this is the farmer organi­ sations.  To emphasise, whenever they said they did not want it on the beef side, I very quickly said there would be none.  I was absolutely clear that there would not be any.  That marries very well with my own approach of backing the beef sector.  I continue to engage with them in regard to the dairy vision group considerations in this matter. ",

The EPA has stated that five of those sites have been put on a priori­ ty list for enforcement action after serious and repeated concerns were raised over discharges to local water sources.  Of the five, four are in the meat or dairy sector, namely, Kepak Athleague, North Cork Co-Op Creameries, Aurivo Dairy Ingredients and Western Brand Group.  The EPA has warned that breaches by food and drink firms threaten the so-called clean and green image of the sector which is crucial to its success.  I would argue that part of its success is the light- touch regulation from the State.  We need to come down hard on the way food is produced and food quality in this country in the meat producing and dairy sectors, not just for reasons of water quality but also due to the emissions that will harm our CO2 reduction targets.",

Of the five, four are in the meat or dairy sector, namely, Kepak Athleague, North Cork Co-Op Creameries, Aurivo Dairy Ingredients and Western Brand Group.  The EPA has warned that breaches by food and drink firms threaten the so-called clean and green image of the sector which is crucial to its success.  I would argue that part of its success is the light- touch regulation from the State.  We need to come down hard on the way food is produced and food quality in this country in the meat producing and dairy sectors, not just for reasons of water quality but also due to the emissions that will harm our CO2 reduction targets.",

  "Exact Text": "'greenhouse gas emissions' I thank Deputy Cahill for raising this important issue and for outlining the benefits that genotyp­ ing would have for our national herd.  As the Deputy knows, this is a matter that I have spoken on recently.  I have outlined clearly that it is my ambition to ensure that Ireland’s is the first beef herd in the world to be fully genotyped.  I look forward to taking steps towards that and ensur­ ing we can deliver on it. Food Vision 2030 is our ten-year strategy for the sustainable development of the agriculture and food sectors.  It is our lighthouse policy.  Under it, I established two groups - the dairy Food Vision group and the beef and sheep Food Vision group - to advise on how we can meet our 25% emissions reduction target by 2030.  In terms of contributing to that, one of the key measures that the groups agreed and advised on was the development of methane-mitigating breeding strategies to build efficiency traits.  The key initial component that would be needed to underpin these breeding strategies is a national genotyping strategy. Genotyping the national herd, and acting effectively in response to the information gathered from that, has the potential to impact positively on farmers’ economic and environmental sus­ tainability.  Traditionally, the genetic improvement of farmed livestock has been based on the use of data collected on animals in the breeding programme, namely, identification, ancestry and animal performance.  Since 2009, this has been increasingly complemented by the addition of genomic, or DNA profile, data.  Through having precise knowledge of the DNA markers as­ sociated with the genotype of each animal, livestock breeders can increase the accuracy of se­ lection for traits of interest for both dairy and meat productivity and quality and more recently, methane output.  This can result in an almost doubling of the rates of genetic gain achievable, compared to conventional breeding programmes.  In addition to improving economic and envi­ ronmental sustainability, genotyping the national herd would have a number of co-benefits, in­ cluding providing a unique selling point in terms of traceability, which is important for market­ ing our quality produce; and providing greater certainty about the quality of dairy beef calves, with benefits both for the farmers rearing those calves and for calf health and welfare. In Ireland we are well placed to develop work in this area.  Currently, Ireland has a relatively high level of genotyping when compared to other countries through innovative programmes such as the beef data and genomics programme and the soon-to-be-launched suckler carbon ef­ ficiency programme.  Work undertaken by Teagasc and the ICBF has highlighted the significant benefits that can accrue to Irish farmers and related industries with higher genetic merit herds being more profitable and with a lower carbon footprint than lower genetic merit herds. I am cognisant of and welcome the strong support of all stakeholders for genotyping of the national cattle herd.  My ambition is that Ireland will become the first country in the world to genotype all livestock in the country.  I want this to happen, I am determined that it will happen and I believe it will happen.  By delivering it, we will continue to show the world that Ireland is more than an outpost on the edge of Europe.  We will show that Ireland is a leader worldwide in our beef product.  We are leaders and pioneers.  We have a beef sector that is the envy of the world.  As the Deputy is aware, the starting point in all of this is the farmer who calves the cow, rears the calf, produces the weanling or store and ultimately, finishes the animal.  I am consider­ ing with my team how this might be achieved, having regard to the funding that will be neces­ sary, the climate impact and a variety of organisational and logistical challenges.  We can only do this if we are satisfied that it will lead to a real and measurable reduction in emissions and productivity.  The Department and I will continue to engage with these stakeholders with a view to fleshing out and taking forward these proposals.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter today, and for his strong advocacy for this as a strategy and a way forward for our beef industry.",

  "Exact Text": "I am thankful for the opportunity to talk about this subject again.  It seems to me that there is a bit of a competition in the House on the nature restoration law with various groups wanting to prove they are the ones most opposed to it.  This is the second time in a week we have had a lengthy motion essentially calling for an outright rejection of the pro­ posed nature restoration law.  One must wonder what nature did to deserve such attention.  At least this motion differs from last week’s motion where we had a conjuring up of a lurid fantasy of 200,000 cattle being culled in the fields of Ireland. This is an odd fish because in many parts it is hard to disagree with.  It states some basic facts but then ends with just as determined a call for total rejection and demands that various guarantees are inserted.  Oddly enough, from my understanding of the proposed and modest law, guarantees are already there to ensure that any rewetting of bogs, for example, is volun­ tary.  This motion, at least, does acknowledge that there is a biodiversity crisis, before going on to explain that it is not as urgent as to require any actual actions, and that anyway it is not just the fault of agriculture - it is the fault of forestry, of invasive species, of urbanisation, and so on.  If anyone and everyone is responsible, really it is no one’s fault, and certainly nobody can be asked to do anything about it.  It seems that Deputies might support a cull on mink as a response, but do not ask them to reduce the dairy herd or even think of restoring the already supposedly protected sites for nature.  That would be going too far. It is odd that having identified the forestry policy as one of the multiple pressures on nature, the motion does not explain why a commercial monoculture policy that has planted an invasive species on lands and bogs for commercial profit has damaged nature here, or why the State’s forestry arm, Coillte, is one of the greatest forces for harm to nature and how its latest deal with Gresham House Investments ensures the hardening of policy in the years ahead. It is also odd that the motion forgets to mention the EU Commission’s state of nature report for 2020, which specifically emphasises the negative impact of intensive agriculture, with farm­ land birds and pollinator habitats being particularly affected.  As one of the report’s authors said at the time, the report “drives home quite how urgent action has become to save what’s left of Europe’s nature”. It is worth saying again for the record that we are living in an era of a sixth mass extinction event.  The Deputies who propose this and other motions were, like myself, lucky enough to be born at a time of greater species diversity, of greater numbers of pollinators and of lower CO2 levels.  We have a sense of what the loss is, or least we should have that sense, because we can see it in real time in the decline of nature all around us.  The younger generation, unfortunately, will not know of this, aside from documentaries or records kept in a museum. If one is arguing here that this law is not good enough, then fair enough.  There is, however, a moral, social and political duty on us to propose an alternative, to acknowledge the great and devastating harm done and being done to nature, and to address the issue.  The motion here does, at least, address what causes the damage but only to claim that agriculture should not be asked to shoulder a disproportionate burden of any measure.  What do we mean by agriculture, especially here in Ireland?  I have never heard these Deputies acknowledge that there is a huge class divide in agriculture; mention that farm incomes have such a huge spread of inequality, with many earning less than €10,000 or €20,000 per year while others can earn up to €100,000 or €200,000; or discuss the geographic aspect to that inequality. We have a broken and unsustainable model of agriculture here that is punishing many or­ dinary farmers.  It has done so for years by pushing a type of intensive dairy model that has enriched a few and made the lives of many farmers more precarious.  Addressing the nature and climate crises could be an opportunity to address that inequality and to allow family farms and sustainable agriculture to thrive.  It could take on the vested interests of the processors and retailers, for example.  It could move away from the insane policy of growing the dairy herd, with all its negative impacts on water quality and on sustainable farming.  It could reward farm­ ers for actually feeding the world and not insist they create markets abroad for dairy products. Once again, this motion taps into the fear that farmers and farming communities feel.  Some of that fear is deliberately stoked up with false and misleading takes on this and other measures, but the fears are real.  Poorer and smaller farmers rightly fear that they will be asked to make the changes in order to allow larger and more damaging dairy practices, for example, to continue and that rewetting would be banked so carbon credits will allow Goodman-type enterprises to continue with business as usual.  This is not a wholly irrational fear.  Farmers have seen how this State, at all levels, will push the vested interests of a minority of the rich and wealthy re­ gardless of its impact on our environment or on the majority of farmers. When ones takes away the bluff and bluster in this and previous motions, what we have is a call for the status quo to remain.  While nature may be dying before our eyes, the central mes­ sage here is not to do anything to address it and certainly not to try to change the business model that has served a few so well. As I said last week, there is much to be angry about in rural Ireland, including the policies this Government has implemented, with climate change and nature loss among them. Years ago a popular piece of graffiti was doing the rounds.  It was an image of a bee and it was saying “If I go, you’re coming with me”.  It meant that if we lose keystone species like bees - if they per­ ish - our future is in doubt.  We are a part of nature.  The demand to preserve the status quo is a demand to continue the slide into the sixth great extinction event.  It does not stop with bees and all Members here would do well to remember that.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I am thankful for the opportunity to talk about this subject again.  It seems to me that there is a bit of a competition in the House on the nature restoration law with various groups wanting to prove they are the ones most opposed to it.  This is the second time in a week we have had a lengthy motion essentially calling for an outright rejection of the pro­ posed nature restoration law.  One must wonder what nature did to deserve such attention.  At least this motion differs from last week’s motion where we had a conjuring up of a lurid fantasy of 200,000 cattle being culled in the fields of Ireland. This is an odd fish because in many parts it is hard to disagree with.  It states some basic facts but then ends with just as determined a call for total rejection and demands that various guarantees are inserted.  Oddly enough, from my understanding of the proposed and modest law, guarantees are already there to ensure that any rewetting of bogs, for example, is volun­ tary.  This motion, at least, does acknowledge that there is a biodiversity crisis, before going on to explain that it is not as urgent as to require any actual actions, and that anyway it is not just the fault of agriculture - it is the fault of forestry, of invasive species, of urbanisation, and so on.  If anyone and everyone is responsible, really it is no one’s fault, and certainly nobody can be asked to do anything about it.  It seems that Deputies might support a cull on mink as a response, but do not ask them to reduce the dairy herd or even think of restoring the already supposedly protected sites for nature.  That would be going too far. It is odd that having identified the forestry policy as one of the multiple pressures on nature, the motion does not explain why a commercial monoculture policy that has planted an invasive species on lands and bogs for commercial profit has damaged nature here, or why the State’s forestry arm, Coillte, is one of the greatest forces for harm to nature and how its latest deal with Gresham House Investments ensures the hardening of policy in the years ahead. It is also odd that the motion forgets to mention the EU Commission’s state of nature report for 2020, which specifically emphasises the negative impact of intensive agriculture, with farm­ land birds and pollinator habitats being particularly affected.  As one of the report’s authors said at the time, the report “drives home quite how urgent action has become to save what’s left of Europe’s nature”. It is worth saying again for the record that we are living in an era of a sixth mass extinction event.  The Deputies who propose this and other motions were, like myself, lucky enough to be born at a time of greater species diversity, of greater numbers of pollinators and of lower CO2 levels.  We have a sense of what the loss is, or least we should have that sense, because we can see it in real time in the decline of nature all around us.  The younger generation, unfortunately, will not know of this, aside from documentaries or records kept in a museum. If one is arguing here that this law is not good enough, then fair enough.  There is, however, a moral, social and political duty on us to propose an alternative, to acknowledge the great and devastating harm done and being done to nature, and to address the issue.  The motion here does, at least, address what causes the damage but only to claim that agriculture should not be asked to shoulder a disproportionate burden of any measure.  What do we mean by agriculture, especially here in Ireland?  I have never heard these Deputies acknowledge that there is a huge class divide in agriculture; mention that farm incomes have such a huge spread of inequality, with many earning less than €10,000 or €20,000 per year while others can earn up to €100,000 or €200,000; or discuss the geographic aspect to that inequality. We have a broken and unsustainable model of agriculture here that is punishing many or­ dinary farmers.  It has done so for years by pushing a type of intensive dairy model that has enriched a few and made the lives of many farmers more precarious.  Addressing the nature and climate crises could be an opportunity to address that inequality and to allow family farms and sustainable agriculture to thrive.  It could take on the vested interests of the processors and retailers, for example.  It could move away from the insane policy of growing the dairy herd, with all its negative impacts on water quality and on sustainable farming.  It could reward farm­ ers for actually feeding the world and not insist they create markets abroad for dairy products. Once again, this motion taps into the fear that farmers and farming communities feel.  Some of that fear is deliberately stoked up with false and misleading takes on this and other measures, but the fears are real.  Poorer and smaller farmers rightly fear that they will be asked to make the changes in order to allow larger and more damaging dairy practices, for example, to continue and that rewetting would be banked so carbon credits will allow Goodman-type enterprises to continue with business as usual.  This is not a wholly irrational fear.  Farmers have seen how this State, at all levels, will push the vested interests of a minority of the rich and wealthy re­ gardless of its impact on our environment or on the majority of farmers. When ones takes away the bluff and bluster in this and previous motions, what we have is a call for the status quo to remain.  While nature may be dying before our eyes, the central mes­ sage here is not to do anything to address it and certainly not to try to change the business model that has served a few so well. As I said last week, there is much to be angry about in rural Ireland, including the policies this Government has implemented, with climate change and nature loss among them. Years ago a popular piece of graffiti was doing the rounds.  It was an image of a bee and it was saying “If I go, you’re coming with me”.  It meant that if we lose keystone species like bees - if they per­ ish - our future is in doubt.  We are a part of nature.  The demand to preserve the status quo is a demand to continue the slide into the sixth great extinction event.  It does not stop with bees and all Members here would do well to remember that.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome the Minister to the House.  I imagine we are go­ ing to have many more conversations about this particular issue as Brexit unfolds and as the implications become more apparent.  It is fair to say that we have journeyed a long way since 1 January 1973 when we joined Europe.  Most of our external trade was bilateral trade with the UK.  We diversified into so many areas.  To this day, agriculture and the agrifood sectors still account for a vast amount of exports to the UK.  Of our exports, 43% or €5.1 billion in 2015 went to the UK.  Conversely, we imported 47% of total agri-sector imports from the UK, com­ prising €3.8 billion.  This figure compares with 14% of exports in other sectors.  Therefore, our agriculture and agrifood sectors are unique and in a more precarious situation, one might argue, because of our dependence on that market. We already know that many analyses have been undertaken.  In November 2015 the ESRI estimated that we could see as much as a 20% drop in trade flow between the two countries. Without a doubt, that would pose great difficulties for us. The mushroom industry has been mentioned.  Given the nature of the industry it is a good case study.  Immediately we are seeing the impact of the drop in sterling and currency fluctua­ tion.  We can learn a good deal from what is happening to the mushroom farmers and we can be decisive about what interventions work.  We know that 70,000 tonnes of mushrooms are produced in this country with 60,000 tonnes going to the UK.  There is extraordinary depen­ dence on that market.  Already, a number of smaller operations have closed.  It is testament to those who are there and have captured the market in the UK, competing with UK producers and producers from eastern Europe who are also dealing with the challenge posed by Brexit and the currency fluctuation.  What specific interventions will the Minister make because farming is the backbone of our economy and everyone in the sector has been dealing with international market volatility?  The mushroom industry is particularly affected by Brexit.  Many of the Minister’s interventions in respect of beef and dairy products have been to try to find new markets.  While mushrooms and other vegetables are perishable there are new ways to transport them and with assistance perhaps new markets can be explored.  The people in the mushroom industry who appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine are inno­ vative and do a fine job against the odds of exporting into England.  Working with the industry can lead to results and help them get through the difficult time.  What in particular is being done for the mushroom industry? We made statements on the budget and I welcome the suite of measures, investments and programmes in the Minister’s Department, in particular the provision for low-cost access to credit.  Farmers are paid intermittently by cheque, whether for cattle or produce or through payments from the Department but in the meantime what do they live on?  It is important to protect farmers from the banks which do not treat any sector fairly, whether business or home owners, because they do not pass on the benefits of the low-cost credit they get from Europe. This intervention is very apt and welcome. Fishermen may be restricted from going where they can fish and we do not know how the UK will proceed in this respect.  Do we have preliminary feedback on this or on stock manage­ ment for shared fisheries?  Many of the codes or negotiated management agreements with other countries have a tendency to break down.  This is fishermen’s livelihoods.  Will the Minister address some of the concerns of the fishing industry? On a related matter that affects the bigger picture, farmers and farm organisations are con­ cerned about the demand to reduce our carbon emissions and how that affects farming.  The United Nations ambassador for climate justice, the former President Mary Robinson, suggested recently that people should move towards vegetarianism and veganism to halt climate change. Any such statements should be grounded in reality and, if we want to bring people with us, we have to meet them where they are.  I commend her on taking on this job.  Climate change af­ fects everybody and she has brilliant stature and experience working on other issues around the world, but I do not subscribe to this proposition.  It conflicts with Food Wise 2025.  What is the Minister doing to allay people’s fears because meat and dairy products are part of a balanced diet for people in this country?  The only other source is high-protein food crops, which are developed in the tropics, in the southern hemisphere, and that would involve taking food from people who are already hard pressed to feed themselves. There is also a great deal of food waste because of the way supermarkets grade food, for example, if a tomato or mushroom is ugly it is discarded even though it has the same nutritional quality as one that is not.  United Nations statistics show that 1.3 billion tonnes of food are lost or wasted every year around the world, which is equivalent to the number of people malnour­ ished or hungry.  In Europe we waste enough food to feed 870 million people.  We should begin to study food waste here and the energy required to produce and transport food.  This would be a more realistic step to reduce our carbon footprint and address some of the problems facing the world.  Ms Robinson’s proposal is out of touch with the reality of how we need to live and the farmers who produce food.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I welcome the Minister to the House.  I imagine we are go­ ing to have many more conversations about this particular issue as Brexit unfolds and as the implications become more apparent.  It is fair to say that we have journeyed a long way since 1 January 1973 when we joined Europe.  Most of our external trade was bilateral trade with the UK.  We diversified into so many areas.  To this day, agriculture and the agrifood sectors still account for a vast amount of exports to the UK.  Of our exports, 43% or €5.1 billion in 2015 went to the UK.  Conversely, we imported 47% of total agri-sector imports from the UK, com­ prising €3.8 billion.  This figure compares with 14% of exports in other sectors.  Therefore, our agriculture and agrifood sectors are unique and in a more precarious situation, one might argue, because of our dependence on that market. We already know that many analyses have been undertaken.  In November 2015 the ESRI estimated that we could see as much as a 20% drop in trade flow between the two countries. Without a doubt, that would pose great difficulties for us. The mushroom industry has been mentioned.  Given the nature of the industry it is a good case study.  Immediately we are seeing the impact of the drop in sterling and currency fluctua­ tion.  We can learn a good deal from what is happening to the mushroom farmers and we can be decisive about what interventions work.  We know that 70,000 tonnes of mushrooms are produced in this country with 60,000 tonnes going to the UK.  There is extraordinary depen­ dence on that market.  Already, a number of smaller operations have closed.  It is testament to those who are there and have captured the market in the UK, competing with UK producers and producers from eastern Europe who are also dealing with the challenge posed by Brexit and the currency fluctuation.  What specific interventions will the Minister make because farming is the backbone of our economy and everyone in the sector has been dealing with international market volatility?  The mushroom industry is particularly affected by Brexit.  Many of the Minister’s interventions in respect of beef and dairy products have been to try to find new markets.  While mushrooms and other vegetables are perishable there are new ways to transport them and with assistance perhaps new markets can be explored.  The people in the mushroom industry who appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine are inno­ vative and do a fine job against the odds of exporting into England.  Working with the industry can lead to results and help them get through the difficult time.  What in particular is being done for the mushroom industry? We made statements on the budget and I welcome the suite of measures, investments and programmes in the Minister’s Department, in particular the provision for low-cost access to credit.  Farmers are paid intermittently by cheque, whether for cattle or produce or through payments from the Department but in the meantime what do they live on?  It is important to protect farmers from the banks which do not treat any sector fairly, whether business or home owners, because they do not pass on the benefits of the low-cost credit they get from Europe. This intervention is very apt and welcome. Fishermen may be restricted from going where they can fish and we do not know how the UK will proceed in this respect.  Do we have preliminary feedback on this or on stock manage­ ment for shared fisheries?  Many of the codes or negotiated management agreements with other countries have a tendency to break down.  This is fishermen’s livelihoods.  Will the Minister address some of the concerns of the fishing industry? On a related matter that affects the bigger picture, farmers and farm organisations are con­ cerned about the demand to reduce our carbon emissions and how that affects farming.  The United Nations ambassador for climate justice, the former President Mary Robinson, suggested recently that people should move towards vegetarianism and veganism to halt climate change. Any such statements should be grounded in reality and, if we want to bring people with us, we have to meet them where they are.  I commend her on taking on this job.  Climate change af­ fects everybody and she has brilliant stature and experience working on other issues around the world, but I do not subscribe to this proposition.  It conflicts with Food Wise 2025.  What is the Minister doing to allay people’s fears because meat and dairy products are part of a balanced diet for people in this country?  The only other source is high-protein food crops, which are developed in the tropics, in the southern hemisphere, and that would involve taking food from people who are already hard pressed to feed themselves. There is also a great deal of food waste because of the way supermarkets grade food, for example, if a tomato or mushroom is ugly it is discarded even though it has the same nutritional quality as one that is not.  United Nations statistics show that 1.3 billion tonnes of food are lost or wasted every year around the world, which is equivalent to the number of people malnour­ ished or hungry.  In Europe we waste enough food to feed 870 million people.  We should begin to study food waste here and the energy required to produce and transport food.  This would be a more realistic step to reduce our carbon footprint and address some of the problems facing the world.  Ms Robinson’s proposal is out of touch with the reality of how we need to live and the farmers who produce food.",

We also need a proper debate about supports and grants for farmers to help them to convert to renewable energy to achieve more energy efficiency.  I say this in the context of the comments made last week by the former President, Mrs. Mary Robinson, who suggested the best way forward was that we either became vegetarians or vegans.  I do not subscribe to what she said and do not believe it is realistic.  We should have a realistic debate. A more realistic and immediate approach would be to eliminate food waste.  In Europe alone we waste enough food to feed 200 million people per annum.  It costs energy to produce and transport food.  If we get rid of meat and dairy, what will we do for the necessary proteins?  Will we get these protein rich food crops that are only grown in the tropics and take the food from people in developing countries and transport it here?  We need a realistic debate because farm­ ers and others are worried.  We need to be environmentally responsible, but let us take realistic steps.  Let us have the Minister here to have a proper debate.  We need to get supports in place.

  "Exact Text": "'horticulture industry: statements' I welcome the Minister to the Chamber for this important de­ bate.  When it comes to agriculture, for the most part it is not the horticulture industry that grabs the headlines.  It tends to be the beef or dairy sectors, but that does not take from the importance of the horticulture sector in terms of complementary farming. The Minister gave us a figure for the valuation of output at the farm gate of €400 million.  I had a figure of €350 million from Teagasc from 2015, so I am not sure which is correct.  In any event, horticulture covers a myriad of produce from mushrooms, protected crops, vegetables, fruits, flowers, foliage and other nursery crops.  For the most part, we export that produce. What is unique for many businesses and producers is that the horticulture industry is very labour intensive.  It is not as mechanised and requires more people to be involved.  Before the budget, representatives of the mushroom sector came before the Joint Committee on Agricul­ ture, Food and the Marine and set out that 3,500 people work for them, with 60 producers in­ volved.  As my colleague said, in 1996 we were talking about 600 producers, so they have had to respond to markets.  There is evidence of smaller producers closing down their businesses, some of it in my county where we see metal frames on concrete foundations lying idle, with nothing going on in them.  I will speak to that briefly later. The mushroom sector, with a farm gate output of €120 million, is one of the most significant aspects of horticulture.  I fully understand the reason its representatives are concerned about Brexit, given that approximately 90% of the 61,000 tonnes produced here goes into the Brit­ ish market.  It is testament to the people behind the mushroom industry here that they have the majority stake in the multiple retailers market in Britain where they compete with producers in the UK and from other countries, including from Poland, although I understand that has de­ clined. The fact that they describe input costs for labour at 40% indicates that it is a very labour- intensive industry.  It speaks for itself.  We want to keep those jobs.  I understand they are under pressure to fill jobs, which is a story that coincides with the recovery in the economy and more jobs being available throughout. Many good points were made in the debate and the Minister has been pre-emptive, particu­ larly in speaking to those in the mushroom industry, but I want to ask some questions.  On the agri cash fund and the €150 million that has been made available by Government, how soon might farmers begin to avail of that because the cost of overdrafts and term loans that the banks are imposing is way above what they borrow the money for from the ECB, which is practically criminal?  The sooner that farmers can be helped with their cashflow, the better. On the producer organisation funding for 2015, why has there been a delay in payment to the commercial mushroom producers?  Such payments would also alleviate cashflow difficul­ ties. On the renewable heat incentive side, the Minister has described the scheme of investment aid for the development of commercial horticulture sector, which is very important.  He is en­ couraging people to consider applying for that to see if there is something they can do.  How­ ever, a good deal of horticulture requires heating and if that is done by way of renewable energy, that suits us on many fronts, in particular in terms of our renewable heating targets, reducing our carbon emissions and so on.  It is not quite within the Minister’s bailiwick but it affects farmers and, ultimately, it can help reduce their input costs. Regarding new markets, the Minister described Bord Bia investing in a market development programme.  With regard to beef and dairy, much work has been done to develop new markets. That is always a good idea because it provides more options and hopefully will improve the price of the commodity.  What practical steps can be taken in that regard, and what markets does the Minister have in mind?  There is an issue about the produce being perishable and the distances over which it can be transported but there are transport solutions that might preserve such perishable goods for a longer period.  What assistance might be available to horticulturists or people in the industry to avail of those solutions? I welcome the grocery goods regulations and in particular a standard provision that the con­ tract be in writing but also that for both retailers and wholesalers, the payment would be made within 30 days.  That is reasonable when we are talking about perishable goods, the lifespan of which is one week or ten days, at best.  However, I agree with a previous speaker that the elephant in the room is the multiple retailers.  Below cost selling is objectionable.  It depresses the price of horticultural products.  Also, the grading done is based on the physical appearance of a piece of fruit or a vegetable.  There is something wrong with that because this country is wasting 100 million tonnes of food a year.  That is not all down to people buying in the super­ market.  Part of the reason is that people in the horticulture industry are required to produce goods that meet the standards of the multiple retailers.  If a tomato has a bump on it but nutri­ tionally is the same as one without a bump, it does not make the grade and can end up on the floor.  That is unsustainable, coupled with below cost selling.  It comes back to low cost selling. We have low cost selling of alcohol, these perishable goods, dairy and so on.  The argument being made is that we do not want to interfere with the market, but the market is artificial and artificial constraints are being put upon farmers.  We have high quality produce but extra costs are being put upon them.  We need more than a laissez-faire attitude.  The issue of below cost selling must be tackled. I would like to hear a vision in terms of what we can do with these frames and concrete foundations lying idle where mushrooms used to be grown previously.  Dealing with those could help more farmers’ markets.  It is the way to proceed to try to get perishable produce grown closer to home. The Minister indicated that he is committed to developing a horticulture forum.  We want to get stakeholders, producers and all people involved in industry around the table to speak to the issues and the challenges we face now and ensure that we can build a bright future for our horticulture industry and that it goes from strength to strength.  When does the Minister of State have in mind to convene such fora?  I ask that he do so as soon as possible.",

It comes back to low cost selling. We have low cost selling of alcohol, these perishable goods, dairy and so on.  The argument being made is that we do not want to interfere with the market, but the market is artificial and artificial constraints are being put upon farmers.  We have high quality produce but extra costs are being put upon them.  We need more than a laissez-faire attitude.  The issue of below cost selling must be tackled. I would like to hear a vision in terms of what we can do with these frames and concrete foundations lying idle where mushrooms used to be grown previously.  Dealing with those could help more farmers’ markets.  It is the way to proceed to try to get perishable produce grown closer to home. The Minister indicated that he is committed to developing a horticulture forum.  We want to get stakeholders, producers and all people involved in industry around the table to speak to the issues and the challenges we face now and ensure that we can build a bright future for our horticulture industry and that it goes from strength to strength.  When does the Minister of State have in mind to convene such fora?  I ask that he do so as soon as possible.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  Fianna Fáil has a strong re­ cord in introducing progressive measures to tackle climate change which is perhaps the single greatest threat to the future of our children and grandchildren.  By contrast, the Government has repeatedly ducked and dived in tackling climate change.  Its policies lack a strategic vision and have fundamentally failed to progress the decarbonisation of the economy. We welcome the opportunity to discuss the 2016 annual national transition statement on climate action and low carbon development published last December and the initiatives being carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this area.  The EU 2020 target for Ireland was to reduce emissions by 20%.  The Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, has estimated that Ireland will reduce its non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions by 6% to 11% from 2005 levels by 2020, or significantly below our reduction target of 20%. Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions profile is unique within Europe in that it is heavily weighted towards agriculture owing to the lack of heavy industry within the overall economy. However, it is important to stress that since 1990 agricultural emissions in Ireland have reduced by 9.7%, while emissions in other areas such as transport have increased by over 120%.  The in­ clusion of land use, land use change and forestry within the scope of the new EU climate change framework will be a welcome development and represent a sensible approach to broaden the tools available to Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration. In 2015 total national greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be 3.7% higher than in 2014.  Agriculture remains the single largest contributor to overall emissions, at 33% of the total.  The transport and energy industries are the second and third largest contributors, at 19.8% and 19.7%, respectively.  Agricultural emissions increased by 1.5% in 2015, most likely reflecting the expansion of the dairy herd in the post-quota era.  However, this is not because agricultural output is highly polluting.  In fact, Ireland is one of the most highly intensive, low­ est carbon food producers in the world.  The carbon footprint per kilogramme of output of Irish farms is one of the lowest in the world.  According to the Joint Research Centre of the Euro­ pean Commission, the Irish dairy sector is the most efficient in the European Union in terms of carbon dioxide per kilogram of milk.  The director of agricultural policy at the World Bank has lauded the contribution Ireland is making to tackling climate change.  I quote: “If every cow was as good as the top 10% of cows in Ireland, we would have one-third less methane emissions on this planet.” Bord Bia argues that there could be significant economic gains from raising standards on less efficient farms through the use of more carbon efficient technology.  According to it, a reduction of 10% in the beef industry’s carbon footprint through the use of more efficient food production technologies could make it the most carbon efficient in Europe and generate addi­ tional on-farm income in the region of of €300 million per year, as well as improving our green image on global food markets. I acknowledge the role of the farm schemes in promoting the reduction of greenhouse gases. The green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, promotes low-carbon agriculture, the delivery of targeted environmental advice and best practice at farm level. The objective of the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is to lower the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd. The carbon navigator is a key component of the scheme.  It delivers feedback and advice on practices that effectively reduce the carbon footprint of farm produce and improve the eco­ nomic performance of a farm.  It encourages the shift in slurry application from the summer to the spring, a practice which can help to significantly reduce emissions.  Knowledge transfer is vitally important in this area for the transfer and exchange of information to farmers on a wide range of topics, including sustainability and husbandry practices which contribute to climate action, for example, animal health, breeding and nutrient management. Organic farming naturally is a major contributor.  It promotes organic agriculture as an al­ ternative farming system, contributing to improved soil quality, the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. The targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, provides for capital investment in a number of target areas to promote sustainability, for example, in low emissions slurry spreading equipment, farm nutrient storage and renewable energy efficiency. While I acknowledge these schemes, we could achieve more.  Fianna Fáil is supportive of environmentally sustainable farming.  The model of Irish cattle production is among the most environmentally sustainable on the planet.  Final negotiations on EU 2030 targets must underpin the need for food security and the central role of an exporting country such as Ireland which has an efficient food production sector.  Irish and EU food security concerns must be put on an equal footing with climate change concerns.  Among developed nations, Ireland is second only to New Zealand in having the highest proportion of total greenhouse emissions from agriculture, at 33%.  This compares with an EU average of 10%.  As stated previously, it must be recognised that this dominance is due to the central role of agriculture in the economy and the absence of high polluting heavy industry.  There is a risk that by setting onerous and unrealistic targets for methane and ammonia - emitted mainly by the beef and dairy industries - as proposed by some commentators there could actually be an adverse effect by shifting food production to lower cost but far less carbon efficient countries. It is essential that Ireland get a fair deal in the negotiations on the technical details associ­ ated with greenhouse gas reduction targets and their measurement.  Ireland needs to push for land use, land use change and forestry to be recognised as providing a major contribution to greenhouse gas target measurement.  We welcome the inclusion of this feature in the scope of the draft EU 2030 binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets published in July 2016. This feature can afford huge opportunities to Ireland to achieve win-win outcomes in meeting our reduction targets.  For example, only 11% of our land is forested compared to 33% across the European Union.  Afforestation has high potential to help us to meet our emissions targets. Even the forests planted since 1990 absorb a massive 18% of agriculture’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.  At the same time, the economic returns from forestry are strongly competitive compared to those from other land uses and could yield a high dividend in terms of regional development and employment. It is essential that as a country we live up to this agreement and meet our emissions reduc­ tion and renewable targets across all areas.  We also need to do more to ensure Ireland meets its climate justice commitments, including making progressive contributions to the cost of ad­ aptation, mitigation and emissions reduction measures in developing countries.  It is unfortu­ nate that the Government has been so slow in introducing innovative schemes to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction and climate justice targets.  Although the latest emission reduction figures are encouraging for some sectors, they show that much more needs to be done.  While progress has been made by some areas, especially electricity production and agriculture, to meet our 2020 emissions reduction targets, almost no progress has been made in other areas since 2011, notably home heating and transport.  There is no policy in place for reducing home heating emissions, and despite paying lip service to renewable transport, the Government has effectively given up on meeting our targets by 2020.  Fianna Fáil is fully committed to meeting our 2020 targets in these areas and has a detailed policy plan for achieving this.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  Fianna Fáil has a strong re­ cord in introducing progressive measures to tackle climate change which is perhaps the single greatest threat to the future of our children and grandchildren.  By contrast, the Government has repeatedly ducked and dived in tackling climate change.  Its policies lack a strategic vision and have fundamentally failed to progress the decarbonisation of the economy. We welcome the opportunity to discuss the 2016 annual national transition statement on climate action and low carbon development published last December and the initiatives being carried out by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in this area.  The EU 2020 target for Ireland was to reduce emissions by 20%.  The Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, has estimated that Ireland will reduce its non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions by 6% to 11% from 2005 levels by 2020, or significantly below our reduction target of 20%. Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions profile is unique within Europe in that it is heavily weighted towards agriculture owing to the lack of heavy industry within the overall economy. However, it is important to stress that since 1990 agricultural emissions in Ireland have reduced by 9.7%, while emissions in other areas such as transport have increased by over 120%.  The in­ clusion of land use, land use change and forestry within the scope of the new EU climate change framework will be a welcome development and represent a sensible approach to broaden the tools available to Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration. In 2015 total national greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to be 3.7% higher than in 2014.  Agriculture remains the single largest contributor to overall emissions, at 33% of the total.  The transport and energy industries are the second and third largest contributors, at 19.8% and 19.7%, respectively.  Agricultural emissions increased by 1.5% in 2015, most likely reflecting the expansion of the dairy herd in the post-quota era.  However, this is not because agricultural output is highly polluting.  In fact, Ireland is one of the most highly intensive, low­ est carbon food producers in the world.  The carbon footprint per kilogramme of output of Irish farms is one of the lowest in the world.  According to the Joint Research Centre of the Euro­ pean Commission, the Irish dairy sector is the most efficient in the European Union in terms of carbon dioxide per kilogram of milk.  The director of agricultural policy at the World Bank has lauded the contribution Ireland is making to tackling climate change.  I quote: “If every cow was as good as the top 10% of cows in Ireland, we would have one-third less methane emissions on this planet.” Bord Bia argues that there could be significant economic gains from raising standards on less efficient farms through the use of more carbon efficient technology.  According to it, a reduction of 10% in the beef industry’s carbon footprint through the use of more efficient food production technologies could make it the most carbon efficient in Europe and generate addi­ tional on-farm income in the region of of €300 million per year, as well as improving our green image on global food markets. I acknowledge the role of the farm schemes in promoting the reduction of greenhouse gases. The green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, promotes low-carbon agriculture, the delivery of targeted environmental advice and best practice at farm level. The objective of the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is to lower the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by improving the quality and efficiency of the national beef herd. The carbon navigator is a key component of the scheme.  It delivers feedback and advice on practices that effectively reduce the carbon footprint of farm produce and improve the eco­ nomic performance of a farm.  It encourages the shift in slurry application from the summer to the spring, a practice which can help to significantly reduce emissions.  Knowledge transfer is vitally important in this area for the transfer and exchange of information to farmers on a wide range of topics, including sustainability and husbandry practices which contribute to climate action, for example, animal health, breeding and nutrient management. Organic farming naturally is a major contributor.  It promotes organic agriculture as an al­ ternative farming system, contributing to improved soil quality, the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. The targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, provides for capital investment in a number of target areas to promote sustainability, for example, in low emissions slurry spreading equipment, farm nutrient storage and renewable energy efficiency. While I acknowledge these schemes, we could achieve more.  Fianna Fáil is supportive of environmentally sustainable farming.  The model of Irish cattle production is among the most environmentally sustainable on the planet.  Final negotiations on EU 2030 targets must underpin the need for food security and the central role of an exporting country such as Ireland which has an efficient food production sector.  Irish and EU food security concerns must be put on an equal footing with climate change concerns.  Among developed nations, Ireland is second only to New Zealand in having the highest proportion of total greenhouse emissions from agriculture, at 33%.  This compares with an EU average of 10%.  As stated previously, it must be recognised that this dominance is due to the central role of agriculture in the economy and the absence of high polluting heavy industry.  There is a risk that by setting onerous and unrealistic targets for methane and ammonia - emitted mainly by the beef and dairy industries - as proposed by some commentators there could actually be an adverse effect by shifting food production to lower cost but far less carbon efficient countries. It is essential that Ireland get a fair deal in the negotiations on the technical details associ­ ated with greenhouse gas reduction targets and their measurement.  Ireland needs to push for land use, land use change and forestry to be recognised as providing a major contribution to greenhouse gas target measurement.  We welcome the inclusion of this feature in the scope of the draft EU 2030 binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets published in July 2016. This feature can afford huge opportunities to Ireland to achieve win-win outcomes in meeting our reduction targets.  For example, only 11% of our land is forested compared to 33% across the European Union.  Afforestation has high potential to help us to meet our emissions targets. Even the forests planted since 1990 absorb a massive 18% of agriculture’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.  At the same time, the economic returns from forestry are strongly competitive compared to those from other land uses and could yield a high dividend in terms of regional development and employment. It is essential that as a country we live up to this agreement and meet our emissions reduc­ tion and renewable targets across all areas.  We also need to do more to ensure Ireland meets its climate justice commitments, including making progressive contributions to the cost of ad­ aptation, mitigation and emissions reduction measures in developing countries.  It is unfortu­ nate that the Government has been so slow in introducing innovative schemes to achieve our greenhouse gas reduction and climate justice targets.  Although the latest emission reduction figures are encouraging for some sectors, they show that much more needs to be done.  While progress has been made by some areas, especially electricity production and agriculture, to meet our 2020 emissions reduction targets, almost no progress has been made in other areas since 2011, notably home heating and transport.  There is no policy in place for reducing home heating emissions, and despite paying lip service to renewable transport, the Government has effectively given up on meeting our targets by 2020.  Fianna Fáil is fully committed to meeting our 2020 targets in these areas and has a detailed policy plan for achieving this.",

  "Exact Text": "I welcome the Minister.  We are having a very important discussion and debate, whereby we can discuss the different sectoral mitigation measures which will feed into the national mitigation plan which is obligatory and which has to be in situ by June this year as I understand it.  To my mind, listening to comments, and we all know about the climate debate, the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol before that, farming tends to get a lot of criticism, and there is a balancing act.  We cannot talk about climate change in agriculture without talking about food security.  We have to look at things in the round.  I believe that is what Government policy is doing.  On the one hand, there has been extreme criticism by people at a very high level that there is no interest in tackling climate change.  Clearly, that is not the case as the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 provides a framework. However, the legislation is nuanced.  As mitigation measures cost money, we must answer the following questions.  Who will bear the cost?  How can we get around the issue?  It is all very well, no more than with health, to say we should spend more but every service must be paid for out of the public purse.  In addition, we do not wish to crush agriculture and leave the sector unproductive.  Instead, we want to grow the sector in a responsible manner.  At the end of the day, people must eat and we need protein. The great thing about this debate is it affords us an opportunity to talk about the good stuff that is happening in the agriculture sector.  The sector represents 33% of the total national emis­ sions but since 1998, which was the peak level, there has been a 13% reduction in emissions by the sector.  There are many reasons for the reduction.  Extensive grasslands emit the lowest emissions and luckily that is what we have with our temperate climate.  Education is provided through the green cert scheme and Teagasc, which are preaching production efficiency, the proper use of fertilisers and grassland management.  We also have Government schemes such as the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the beef data and genomics pro­ gramme and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, as well as organic farming supports. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and together with its other members, I hear how vast the farming industry is all of the time.  At committee meetings we hear from all of the agricultural sectors, the marine sector and the for­ estry sector.  Cost must always be discussed and while imposing a carbon tax would be a crude mechanism, what effect would an increase in the cost of fuel have on farming and on domestic households?  Who will carry the burden of a carbon tax? We must be responsible when it comes to climate change but be willing to compromise.  I refer to the comments of the former President, Mary Robinson, who is now an advocate for climate justice.  While I am in favour of climate justice and am delighted that someone with her profile is an advocate, it is not a good idea to change to crops that are used in energy production but do not suit our climate.  A carbon footprint will be created if we import such crops from the tropics.  Ireland produces beef and dairy products that meet a great part of our protein require­ ments in our diet.  If one talks about Armageddon or about extreme scenarios such as halving the national herd, people switch off.  Let us remember that farmers are responsible people but they must be able to make a living.  If everyone went back far enough they would discover that they hail from a farming background.  Generations of farmers have passed on their knowledge and interests.  They have safeguarded the countryside for so long.  The best way is for us to work with farmers, talk to them and overcome any hurdles. I wish to refer to targets and tackling the mitigation of carbon emissions.  As the Minister will be well aware, food waste is a massive problem and happens in the food chain due to food grading.  Sadly, a lot of nutritional food is discarded for not looking a certain way.  For example, ugly tomatoes do not make the grade.  It costs money to produce and transport food yet food is wasted.  There are initiatives to make greater use of food waste.  Such initiatives would allow us to be more environmentally conscientious and face up to our responsibilities. Microenergy generation is another issue for farmers.  Our policies do not lend themselves to microwind initiatives.  What about introducing district heating systems using biomass and biogas?  As there has been investment in sustainable forestry, there are more opportunities to have in place systems that will grow the sector and add value such as producing wood chip or whatever in rural areas that are crying out for jobs, investment and growth.  The forestry sector would lend itself to further growth and holds potential for rural areas.  Investment in the sector would help us to meet job creation targets. Can the Minister tell me the status of the renewable heat incentivisation scheme?  The hor­ ticultural sector and mushroom growers have raised this issue. On transport, we face challenges in meeting certain targets.  While pilot projects have fo­ cused on big HGVs and the like, how can the Government support farmers with this issue? With all due respect to Senator Paul Daly, nothing he says can change the reality.  He sounds like he has become a member of the Green Party but that is untrue.  The idea that Fianna Fáil made massive strides towards creating a low carbon economy is untrue.  I was a Deputy for five years before becoming a Senator so I know this is not the case.  However, I commend the work that has been done.  We need to bring people with us.  There is no point in making ridiculous statements on how to tackle carbon emissions without discussing how measures will affect the people who will have to make the necessary changes and incur the associated costs and hard­ ships.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I welcome the Minister.  We are having a very important discussion and debate, whereby we can discuss the different sectoral mitigation measures which will feed into the national mitigation plan which is obligatory and which has to be in situ by June this year as I understand it.  To my mind, listening to comments, and we all know about the climate debate, the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol before that, farming tends to get a lot of criticism, and there is a balancing act.  We cannot talk about climate change in agriculture without talking about food security.  We have to look at things in the round.  I believe that is what Government policy is doing.  On the one hand, there has been extreme criticism by people at a very high level that there is no interest in tackling climate change.  Clearly, that is not the case as the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 provides a framework. However, the legislation is nuanced.  As mitigation measures cost money, we must answer the following questions.  Who will bear the cost?  How can we get around the issue?  It is all very well, no more than with health, to say we should spend more but every service must be paid for out of the public purse.  In addition, we do not wish to crush agriculture and leave the sector unproductive.  Instead, we want to grow the sector in a responsible manner.  At the end of the day, people must eat and we need protein. The great thing about this debate is it affords us an opportunity to talk about the good stuff that is happening in the agriculture sector.  The sector represents 33% of the total national emis­ sions but since 1998, which was the peak level, there has been a 13% reduction in emissions by the sector.  There are many reasons for the reduction.  Extensive grasslands emit the lowest emissions and luckily that is what we have with our temperate climate.  Education is provided through the green cert scheme and Teagasc, which are preaching production efficiency, the proper use of fertilisers and grassland management.  We also have Government schemes such as the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, the beef data and genomics pro­ gramme and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, as well as organic farming supports. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and together with its other members, I hear how vast the farming industry is all of the time.  At committee meetings we hear from all of the agricultural sectors, the marine sector and the for­ estry sector.  Cost must always be discussed and while imposing a carbon tax would be a crude mechanism, what effect would an increase in the cost of fuel have on farming and on domestic households?  Who will carry the burden of a carbon tax? We must be responsible when it comes to climate change but be willing to compromise.  I refer to the comments of the former President, Mary Robinson, who is now an advocate for climate justice.  While I am in favour of climate justice and am delighted that someone with her profile is an advocate, it is not a good idea to change to crops that are used in energy production but do not suit our climate.  A carbon footprint will be created if we import such crops from the tropics.  Ireland produces beef and dairy products that meet a great part of our protein require­ ments in our diet.  If one talks about Armageddon or about extreme scenarios such as halving the national herd, people switch off.  Let us remember that farmers are responsible people but they must be able to make a living.  If everyone went back far enough they would discover that they hail from a farming background.  Generations of farmers have passed on their knowledge and interests.  They have safeguarded the countryside for so long.  The best way is for us to work with farmers, talk to them and overcome any hurdles. I wish to refer to targets and tackling the mitigation of carbon emissions.  As the Minister will be well aware, food waste is a massive problem and happens in the food chain due to food grading.  Sadly, a lot of nutritional food is discarded for not looking a certain way.  For example, ugly tomatoes do not make the grade.  It costs money to produce and transport food yet food is wasted.  There are initiatives to make greater use of food waste.  Such initiatives would allow us to be more environmentally conscientious and face up to our responsibilities. Microenergy generation is another issue for farmers.  Our policies do not lend themselves to microwind initiatives.  What about introducing district heating systems using biomass and biogas?  As there has been investment in sustainable forestry, there are more opportunities to have in place systems that will grow the sector and add value such as producing wood chip or whatever in rural areas that are crying out for jobs, investment and growth.  The forestry sector would lend itself to further growth and holds potential for rural areas.  Investment in the sector would help us to meet job creation targets. Can the Minister tell me the status of the renewable heat incentivisation scheme?  The hor­ ticultural sector and mushroom growers have raised this issue. On transport, we face challenges in meeting certain targets.  While pilot projects have fo­ cused on big HGVs and the like, how can the Government support farmers with this issue? With all due respect to Senator Paul Daly, nothing he says can change the reality.  He sounds like he has become a member of the Green Party but that is untrue.  The idea that Fianna Fáil made massive strides towards creating a low carbon economy is untrue.  I was a Deputy for five years before becoming a Senator so I know this is not the case.  However, I commend the work that has been done.  We need to bring people with us.  There is no point in making ridiculous statements on how to tackle carbon emissions without discussing how measures will affect the people who will have to make the necessary changes and incur the associated costs and hard­ ships.",

  "Exact Text": "'climate action and low carbon development act 2015: statements' I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome the oppor­ tunity to discuss the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  I commend the Minister on his comprehensive report on same.  We all understand the job at hand.  The elephant in the room when it comes to agriculture, which is often conveniently ignored by commenta­ tors, is the fact that we never had an industrial revolution in this country and, therefore, agricul­ ture is very prominent in our economy. The outputs from agriculture are always going to be the biggest but I do not think that gets proper coverage.  We are compared with other countries that have massive outputs from indus­ try, transport and energy production and people are given the impression that Irish cows are world polluters.  That is something that must be addressed.  We had much talk this week about the correct and proper use of language.  The image of Ireland that is portrayed and the language that is used is important. This is not a bad news story.  There are targets which need to be met and I would differ with the Minister on how we will achieve those targets.  The Minister hosted a fantastic event on Monday and the FoodWise 2025 document contains brilliant targets which are very achiev­ able.  Indeed, they must be achieved for the future of the sector.  If we are going to increase our output by up to 85%, it stands to reason that our emissions, if not handled extremely well, are also going to increase.  That is evident in the 2.7% increase in greenhouse gas output in the agriculture sector in the last year.  However, that 2.7% increase went hand in hand with a 22% increase in cow numbers and 27% increase in milk production.  We are one of the most carbon efficient producers of dairy products.  If the knee jerk reaction of some and their narrow-minded attitudes to solving or attempting to solve this problem were to be heeded, we would be pushing that food production to other areas of the world that are far less carbon efficient.  That might solve our problem and bring our figures closer to the targets but this is a global issue.  It is not a question of one country ticking its box.  This is a global issue and needs to be viewed as such. In terms of sequestration, I welcome that land use changes and forestry are now included in the 2030 framework.  Sequestration can remove up to 26.8 million tonnes or 27 million tonnes of CO2.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine produced a re­ port recently on the future of the tillage sector.  With that in mind, all sectors need to be involved and there must be joined-up thinking both within the Department and across Departments.  The Minister alluded to that on Monday in his closing remarks at the Food Wise 2025 event.  Agri­ culture reduced its output by 3.5% from 1990 to 2016, which goes unmentioned.  At the same time, transport outputs increased by 139% and energy by 116%.  If we tick all the boxes and achieve our targets within agriculture but the same is not happening in the other carbon emitting sectors, it will not have the desired effect in terms of influencing climate change.  All Depart­ ments need to come on board in this. To refer back to tillage.  We have farmers who are leaving that sector at the moment.  Tillage would not be a major carbon emitter.  In fact, it would have plenty of sequestration opportuni­ ties to offer if we were to look at the diversification of products and the production of biomass crops.  If farmers were able to make a living from tillage they would not be considering giving it up and moving into dairy, which the figures show produces more carbon emissions.  In terms of the overall sector, therefore, we need more joined-up thinking.  We are way off our reduc­ tion targets at the moment.  We are supposed to achieve a 20% reduction by 2020 but it looks like we will come in somewhere between 6% and 11%.  At the same time, there are farmers walking away from tillage which is one area that would actually help to improve those figures. They have no choice if they are to make a living from agriculture but to consider moving into the dairy sector. Incentives in areas such as tillage could help to improve those figures into the future and at the same time help us to achieve our targets of increased food production by 50% by 2050. The requirement to reduce our carbon emissions and at the same time increase food production on a worldwide basis by 50% by 2050 is daunting, but knee-jerk reactions will not serve us well.  The cull of 50,000 cows in the Netherlands as a means of achieving targets was a knee-jerk reaction.  We are seeking to increase our livestock while in the Netherlands they are culling them.  I acknowledge that production in the Netherlands is not nearly as carbon efficient as it is here, but to hear about such high levels of culling is frighten­ ing.  The objective of Foodwise 2025 is to increase production here by 85%.  As worldwide food production must also be increased by 50%, it is catch-22 situation. Some of the schemes introduced have helped to reduce emissions.  The Minister mentioned that there are 25,000 farmers in the genomics scheme and that GLAS has 50,000 members.  I believe GLAS needs to be reviewed in the context of what more can be achieved from it.  We face major fines if we do not meet our targets.  Depending on to whom one speaks, the amount of that fine increases astronomically.  It would be far more beneficial to incentivise or subsidise schemes to assist in achieving our targets rather than spend that money on payment of a fine. This would be money well spent.  The Minister needs to give consideration to this proposal. As I said earlier, this issue needs to be addressed cross-departmentally.  We are speaking specifically about the agriculture sector today but one sector alone will not solve the problem. We need joined-up thinking on this issue.  If the agriculture sector becomes carbon neutral but carbon in the transport sector continues to increase by up to 140%, it does not make sense.",

I commend the Minister on his comprehensive report on same.  We all understand the job at hand.  The elephant in the room when it comes to agriculture, which is often conveniently ignored by commenta­ tors, is the fact that we never had an industrial revolution in this country and, therefore, agricul­ ture is very prominent in our economy. The outputs from agriculture are always going to be the biggest but I do not think that gets proper coverage.  We are compared with other countries that have massive outputs from indus­ try, transport and energy production and people are given the impression that Irish cows are world polluters.  That is something that must be addressed.  We had much talk this week about the correct and proper use of language.  The image of Ireland that is portrayed and the language that is used is important. This is not a bad news story.  There are targets which need to be met and I would differ with the Minister on how we will achieve those targets.  The Minister hosted a fantastic event on Monday and the FoodWise 2025 document contains brilliant targets which are very achiev­ able.  Indeed, they must be achieved for the future of the sector.  If we are going to increase our output by up to 85%, it stands to reason that our emissions, if not handled extremely well, are also going to increase.  That is evident in the 2.7% increase in greenhouse gas output in the agriculture sector in the last year.  However, that 2.7% increase went hand in hand with a 22% increase in cow numbers and 27% increase in milk production.  We are one of the most carbon efficient producers of dairy products.  If the knee jerk reaction of some and their narrow-minded attitudes to solving or attempting to solve this problem were to be heeded, we would be pushing that food production to other areas of the world that are far less carbon efficient.  That might solve our problem and bring our figures closer to the targets but this is a global issue.  It is not a question of one country ticking its box.  This is a global issue and needs to be viewed as such. In terms of sequestration, I welcome that land use changes and forestry are now included in the 2030 framework.  Sequestration can remove up to 26.8 million tonnes or 27 million tonnes of CO2.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine produced a re­ port recently on the future of the tillage sector.  With that in mind, all sectors need to be involved and there must be joined-up thinking both within the Department and across Departments.  The Minister alluded to that on Monday in his closing remarks at the Food Wise 2025 event.  Agri­ culture reduced its output by 3.5% from 1990 to 2016, which goes unmentioned.  At the same time, transport outputs increased by 139% and energy by 116%.  If we tick all the boxes and achieve our targets within agriculture but the same is not happening in the other carbon emitting sectors, it will not have the desired effect in terms of influencing climate change.  All Depart­ ments need to come on board in this. To refer back to tillage.  We have farmers who are leaving that sector at the moment.  Tillage would not be a major carbon emitter.  In fact, it would have plenty of sequestration opportuni­ ties to offer if we were to look at the diversification of products and the production of biomass crops.  If farmers were able to make a living from tillage they would not be considering giving it up and moving into dairy, which the figures show produces more carbon emissions.  In terms of the overall sector, therefore, we need more joined-up thinking.  We are way off our reduc­ tion targets at the moment.  We are supposed to achieve a 20% reduction by 2020 but it looks like we will come in somewhere between 6% and 11%.  At the same time, there are farmers walking away from tillage which is one area that would actually help to improve those figures. They have no choice if they are to make a living from agriculture but to consider moving into the dairy sector. Incentives in areas such as tillage could help to improve those figures into the future and at the same time help us to achieve our targets of increased food production by 50% by 2050. The requirement to reduce our carbon emissions and at the same time increase food production on a worldwide basis by 50% by 2050 is daunting, but knee-jerk reactions will not serve us well.  The cull of 50,000 cows in the Netherlands as a means of achieving targets was a knee-jerk reaction.  We are seeking to increase our livestock while in the Netherlands they are culling them.  I acknowledge that production in the Netherlands is not nearly as carbon efficient as it is here, but to hear about such high levels of culling is frighten­ ing.  The objective of Foodwise 2025 is to increase production here by 85%.  As worldwide food production must also be increased by 50%, it is catch-22 situation. Some of the schemes introduced have helped to reduce emissions.  The Minister mentioned that there are 25,000 farmers in the genomics scheme and that GLAS has 50,000 members.  I believe GLAS needs to be reviewed in the context of what more can be achieved from it.  We face major fines if we do not meet our targets.  Depending on to whom one speaks, the amount of that fine increases astronomically.  It would be far more beneficial to incentivise or subsidise schemes to assist in achieving our targets rather than spend that money on payment of a fine. This would be money well spent.  The Minister needs to give consideration to this proposal. As I said earlier, this issue needs to be addressed cross-departmentally.  We are speaking specifically about the agriculture sector today but one sector alone will not solve the problem. We need joined-up thinking on this issue.  If the agriculture sector becomes carbon neutral but carbon in the transport sector continues to increase by up to 140%, it does not make sense.",

It is clear that we must all be mindful and responsible citizens.  That is the direction in which the conversation is moving, from the top to the bottom. When we try to address problems, the starting point is often identifying the party to blame and then pointing the finger.  The big bad wolf in recent public discourse has been agriculture.  That is very unfair.  I have mentioned this matter at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and elsewhere.  I do not question the bone fides of the Citizens’ Assembly, but I feel it was not presented with a fair picture in the context of agriculture.  The Minister cited the fact that carbon emissions from agriculture and food production have decreased by 3.5% since 1990, while output has increased by 40%.  Output has increased but carbon emissions have decreased.  Equally, we know that some of our systems for dairy and beef are excellent.  We are top of the class for dairy and we are near to the top for beef in terms of our carbon footprint. The Minister outlined some of the measures that have been overseen by his Department. Every single farming scheme devised has to take on board the idea of sustainability, the po­ tential environmental impact, and increasingly how it can serve to reduce our carbon emission reduction objectives.  Farmers know all about this and they know all about the challenges in­ volved.  They operate at the coalface. There has been cold weather again recently.  Animals had to be housed as early as Septem­ ber in some cases, which led to clear problems.  If we are to bring every single stakeholder on board - including farmers - we should start to ground our conversations in reality when we ask people to take certain actions.  We cannot suddenly ask them to go from zero to 100 without providing a roadmap.  We have to empower farmers to make the necessary changes so that they can be more carbon-neutral in their activities.  The blame game puts many people, not just farm­ ers, off, particularly when they really have been pushed to the pin of their collars in terms of commodity volatility in respect, for example, of milk and beef production.  Farmers are work­ ing to the tightest of margins, and they are really trying.  They should get credit for that. The dialogue we are having cannot focus solely on agriculture.  The message must be com­ municated to the broader public that farmers, farming organisations, Teagasc and departmental officials are doing good work and that there is a very real drive towards addressing issues. In terms of the European perspective, I am just back from a trip to Brussels with the joint committee.  The Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development painted a very stark picture for us.  The reality is that there is a very big environmental lobby now which is ex­ tremely proactive and media savvy.  I do not want to take from its objectives or intentions, but the reality is that more and more will be demanded from farmers under the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  That does not take into account the targets we have to meet.  More and more schemes will have to have other dimensions to show that they are environmentally friendly.  Anybody telling us that we are grand and that we should keep going as we are is in­ correct.  There is no doubt that it has to be ramped up.  There will be extra costs involved, and I believe that is a debate we need to have.  We have to stand behind our farmers. Britain is pulling out of the European Union, and there will be a substantial reduction in the new budget.  We have to begin by capturing our budget, and if new measures, whether for water quality or biodiversity, are being introduced for farmers, money will be required.  We are asking farmers to act for the greater good of society.  We need to talk about all of that, and continue to bring farmers on board. In the environmental analysis conducted by the Minister’s Department, the establishment of a sustainability sub-committee to monitor environmental impacts relating to the Food Wise strategy was recommended.  Where do matters stand in that regard?  It is essential that we keep moving in the right direction and that we anticipate any difficulties as we try to produce food. It has been stated already, but I reiterate that we are producing food in the most sustainable way. We need to be fed and it is by means of sustainable farming methods that we should produce our food. I already alluded to the bad weather.  There is concern among farmers that there will be a fodder shortage.  Teagasc is carrying out an assessment of the amount and quality of fodder available.  When farmers are obliged to house animals from early September in anticipation of a long winter, we know that some may get into difficulty.  I suggest that this is part of the fallout from climate change.  The Minister might give some assurance to farmers regarding the actions he is taking on this issue.  He might also outline the options available to farmers if they have hungry animals or if there is an animal welfare issue.  I look forward to the Minister’s response.",

We have to begin by capturing our budget, and if new measures, whether for water quality or biodiversity, are being introduced for farmers, money will be required.  We are asking farmers to act for the greater good of society.  We need to talk about all of that, and continue to bring farmers on board. In the environmental analysis conducted by the Minister’s Department, the establishment of a sustainability sub-committee to monitor environmental impacts relating to the Food Wise strategy was recommended.  Where do matters stand in that regard?  It is essential that we keep moving in the right direction and that we anticipate any difficulties as we try to produce food. It has been stated already, but I reiterate that we are producing food in the most sustainable way. We need to be fed and it is by means of sustainable farming methods that we should produce our food. I already alluded to the bad weather.  There is concern among farmers that there will be a fodder shortage.  Teagasc is carrying out an assessment of the amount and quality of fodder available.  When farmers are obliged to house animals from early September in anticipation of a long winter, we know that some may get into difficulty.  I suggest that this is part of the fallout from climate change.  The Minister might give some assurance to farmers regarding the actions he is taking on this issue.  He might also outline the options available to farmers if they have hungry animals or if there is an animal welfare issue.  I look forward to the Minister’s response.",

  "Exact Text": "'climate action and low carbon development act 2015: statements' I welcome this annual statement.  When it comes to climate change, the fallout and the cost if we do not act, we can never have enough conversations to get to the reality of the consequences and the measures we need to take.  We have to be bold in that regard.  However, we also have to come from a point that is reality so that we can bring people with us.  I have heard of them on television but I have never met anyone who does not think something should be done.  Most of our citizens think something should be done but the issue is who does what.  However, that is about decisions and where we, as policy makers, have to try to strike the right balance. There are two areas I want to focus on in the short time available to me.  First, there will obviously be a cost.  We are talking about changing our lifestyles and technology.  If the internal combustion engine was never invented and we did not rely on it for so many score years, we would already be on the road to diversification.  Transport is a major issue.  We need to make progress on electricity production and heat.  However, it must be acknowledged that progress is being made.  The consultation period for the renewable electricity support scheme has con­ cluded and now we are considering what forms of renewables will be supported and given a tariff so that they can be brought to bear on the equation and make up part of the renewable portfolio for generation of electricity. I know the Minister is examining all options but I think the time has come to consider off­ shore wind.  I agree with colleagues who have spoken about solar panels and biomass.  We can do a lot more in the area of microgeneration, whether it is wind, solar or otherwise.  We need to encourage and empower more citizens to make decisions on electricity generation.  It could make wind turbines a lot more palatable for people if they thought they could have one them­ selves and there were benefits in it for them.  There is a perception now that wind farms are big industry but there is a reason Government is supporting wind farms and so on. Recently I attended a conference by Wind Aware Ireland in Buswell’s Hotel which was cov­ ered by the press.  I believe this group is genuine in what it is saying.  However, I would like the Minister to set out the situation in black and white here today because everything about wind was condemned.  The group was saying that we are spending a lot of money on tariffs which are going to big companies but are not leading to satisfactory carbon emissions.  Percentages were given comparing the amount we have invested in wind with other forms of electricity produc­ tion.  In fairness to the logic, there has to be backup and I understand there needs to be a mix.  I think people misunderstand the arguments for wind.  No one says that wind blows all the time. I have seen so many journalists write, “Eureka!  They are fooling us.  Wind is some big solu­ tion.”  We have to have a suite of solutions because one size does not fit all.  I would like the Minister to speak to these people.  I believe they are genuine.  They are a voluntary group that has come together.  I have my views and I have been to so many talks on these things.  I would like to speak to the fears of people about the wisdom of the way we are spending taxpayers’ money to support wind, the desirability of doing so and plans for the future. The other issue is that of agriculture.  I admire the concept of the Citizens’ Assembly.  I was involved in the Constitutional Convention and understand the power of getting contributions from citizens.  However, agriculture and agrifood got a very hard doing in the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly.  It did not seem to take any cognisance of the fact that agriculture emissions have gone down 6% since 1990 although production has gone up 40%.  Agriculture is key to our economy.  It is in all our plans, including Food Wise 2025.  Many people do not know what it takes to get on an agricultural scheme, whether it is considering ecosystems or environmental steps that have to be taken.  A farmer has to consider environmental impacts and take measures and concrete steps before getting a red cent from Government or the European Union.  They are a misunderstood cohort.

  "Exact Text": "'fodder shortage: motion' I move amendment No. 3: To delete all words after “Seanad Eireann” and substitute the following: “notes: - the major role agriculture plays in creating employment, generating economic ac­ tivity and acting as a custodian of the countryside in Ireland; - the competitive advantage Ireland has in sustainable livestock production, particu­ larly dairy, beef and sheep farming, based on a grass-based production system, which is both relatively low cost and carbon efficient; - the shared Food Wise 2025 strategy for the development of the sector, which high­ lights the opportunities to grow the value of farm output, value added and agri-food exports; growth that must be managed in an environmentally sustainable manner; - the unique vulnerability and exposure of agriculture to fluctuations in the weather; - the on-going hardship due to fluctuations in the weather and the sacrifices farming families have made to protect their livestock; - the role the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc, Co-opera­ tives, Farming organisations and farmers have played in working through this challeng­ ing period; - the securing of an increased advance payment in October 2017 under Pillar I and Pillar II of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP); - the payment of €1.6 billion in CAP direct payments to Irish farmers before the end of 2017, providing an important source of income support for farm families; - that for the first time, in winter/spring of 2017/2018, under a new Sheep Welfare Scheme, advance payments totalling €16 million issued to sheep farmers, with a further €3 million to issue in the coming weeks, providing valuable support to the sheep sector; - the securing of an additional €25 million in Budget 2018 for payments under the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme, where the highest level of support is tar­ geted at those who are faced with the highest level of constraint on their land, bringing the total amount allocated to the 2018 ANC Scheme to €227 million; - the prioritisation by Teagasc of the provision of direct support to these farmers through fodder budgeting and nutritional advice, not only then, but throughout the win­ ter and spring; - the convening of a stakeholder group chaired by Teagasc comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and Co-operatives, banking and farm bodies to monitor the fodder situation; - the timely introduction of a targeted Transport Subsidy Scheme to address the short­ age of supplies of fodder in the North and North West in January this year; - that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is in regular contact with all the stakeholders following the introduction of this scheme; - the timely introduction of a Fodder Import Support Scheme to cover all Co-oper­ atives and importers approved by the Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to import fodder; - the extension of the deadline for the submission of Nitrates derogation plans until 30th April, 2018; - the extension of grazing under the Traditional Hay Meadows (THM) measure in GLAS until 1st May, 2018; - the securing of a commitment towards flexibility in the ‘three crop rule’ under Greening requirements in Pillar 1 of the CAP; - the availability of rapid emergency feed assistance to any farmer facing immediate feed shortage through the Department’s Animal Welfare Helpline that supports the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council’s Early Warning Intervention System (EWS); - the need to ensure that farmers are adequately equipped with the necessary knowl­ edge and advice to deal with fluctuations in the weather and to keep fodder supplies under review; - the one-to-one assistance being provided to farmers by the Department of Agricul­ ture, Food and the Marine to lodge their Basic Payment Scheme applications; - the continuous monitoring of the situation by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc; - the increased regularity of severe weather events and the need to consider the inclu­ sion of appropriate risk management tools to mitigate against the impacts of such events on farming enterprises in the next iteration of the CAP.” I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad Chamber and I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.  The sun is shining in Dublin today but I know from talking to farmers in Mayo and elsewhere that it is not necessarily shining there and in fact shines a lot less.  While the sun is shining, farmers are dealing with a grim situation.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, ap­ peared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last week and going back to the Easter weekend, because the weather did not turn and we still had a cold biting wind, there was no growth.  The ground was wet and ground conditions were poor.  We would have hoped that things might have advanced naturally a lot better than they have but that is not the case.  Animals still are being housed.  Last weekend, some farmers attempted to let their cattle out for a few days, especially dairy farmers, but they are back in again.  In the meantime, since we last spoke, it has been necessary to provide another two weeks of fodder for these ani­ mals.  Animals still cannot be let out at present because they will dig up the ground and no crops will grow to provide fodder for next year.  Farmers are in an awful bind.  We talk about low-cost loans and about flexibility with banks and co-operatives but there are farmers who cannot get credit from their co-operatives any more.  Co-operatives are places with which dairy farmers in particular deal but this is not so much the case with suckler farmers.  They are not neces­ sarily getting credit and the banks are not necessarily showing flexibility.  We cannot assume they are and this is a predicament farmers face.  They continue to have to feed their animals.  I argue that in the north and north west, the fact that this problem was coming down the line was first highlighted when many farmers failed to cut a second crop of silage last autumn, as they normally would have done.  We knew immediately that there would be a problem, that farmers would not be able to provide for their animals in the normal way, that is, the most efficient and cheapest way that farmers can.  Since then, things have got worse around the country with the extended winter and bad weather.  I argue that the farmers in the west and north west are in the worst and most difficult position because some of them have already been buying fodder since January.  Many of them have been buying additional meal to stretch their fodder.  I must agree that the initial transport scheme that was suggested worked very well.  I welcome the flexibili­ ties that were introduced but farmers are dealing with a depressing situation.  My fear - not just for farmers - comes from considering the input that farming and the farming community have to local economies. Rural market towns throughout the country are dependent on farmers and their spending power.  If farmers are up to their necks in debt trying to pay for fodder, with another bill coming down the tracks for fertiliser as they will have to fertilise the land, there will be far less in their pockets for spending in the local economy.  I foresee a depression in rural market towns because if the farmers’ circumstances are on the up, the circumstances of these towns are on the up but, currently, that is not the case.  There is a case to be made, with strict criteria, for farmers who are in very difficult situations to be assisted.  If we do not find some type of formula, and we all accept that the weather is not going to improve suddenly and that we will have to deal with varied and inclement weather for longer periods, many people will leave farming.  Many of the farms where I live are marginal in any case, so why would one opt to farm when there are plenty of options in cities?  We are near to having full employment so why would one plan a career in farming if one is a suckler cow farmer?  These are very big challenges.  I cited this at the committee because it is quite sobering. The reality is that this is a weather problem.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy Creed, that if he had announced last November or December that he was going to start importing fodder, people would have laughed at him.  That does not mean one should not try to take measures. There was fodder in other parts of the country, and the issue was how to get it to the farmers who needed it.  I believe the crisis is as much a financial crisis for farmers, especially for those in the west and north west.  They have paid on a large scale and most of them have not been able to avail of the transport subsidy scheme because it was unworkable for them. We cannot blame the Minister for the weather.  In 2014, according to figures from the De­ partment, there were 6.3 million cattle in this country.  In 2018, before counting calves and the additional stock that are due to be counted by May, the national herd is 7.4 million cattle. In all our plans, our objective is to ramp up production on all sides, so this will be a recurring problem.  We must get a handle on how we are going to deal with this into the future.  There are issues with overstocking, which some farmers have been encouraged to do as there is no milk quota any more.  There must be a reality check about what is happening or we will have farmers on the breadline and people will not wish to get involved in farming.  If that happens we will not achieve the Food Wise 2025 targets. I welcome the news about the opening of the Chinese market which was announced by the Minister, Deputy Creed, during the week.  There is great potential there, but we must get this issue right.  I accept that the Minister is monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis but we will continue to be reminded of these realities, both in this House and in the agriculture committee, and of the fallout from what has happened with the weather.  If it does not improve, we will be talking about this issue a great deal more and very soon again.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I move amendment No. 3: To delete all words after “Seanad Eireann” and substitute the following: “notes: - the major role agriculture plays in creating employment, generating economic ac­ tivity and acting as a custodian of the countryside in Ireland; - the competitive advantage Ireland has in sustainable livestock production, particu­ larly dairy, beef and sheep farming, based on a grass-based production system, which is both relatively low cost and carbon efficient; - the shared Food Wise 2025 strategy for the development of the sector, which high­ lights the opportunities to grow the value of farm output, value added and agri-food exports; growth that must be managed in an environmentally sustainable manner; - the unique vulnerability and exposure of agriculture to fluctuations in the weather; - the on-going hardship due to fluctuations in the weather and the sacrifices farming families have made to protect their livestock; - the role the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Teagasc, Co-opera­ tives, Farming organisations and farmers have played in working through this challeng­ ing period; - the securing of an increased advance payment in October 2017 under Pillar I and Pillar II of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP); - the payment of €1.6 billion in CAP direct payments to Irish farmers before the end of 2017, providing an important source of income support for farm families; - that for the first time, in winter/spring of 2017/2018, under a new Sheep Welfare Scheme, advance payments totalling €16 million issued to sheep farmers, with a further €3 million to issue in the coming weeks, providing valuable support to the sheep sector; - the securing of an additional €25 million in Budget 2018 for payments under the Areas of Natural Constraint (ANC) Scheme, where the highest level of support is tar­ geted at those who are faced with the highest level of constraint on their land, bringing the total amount allocated to the 2018 ANC Scheme to €227 million; - the prioritisation by Teagasc of the provision of direct support to these farmers through fodder budgeting and nutritional advice, not only then, but throughout the win­ ter and spring; - the convening of a stakeholder group chaired by Teagasc comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and Co-operatives, banking and farm bodies to monitor the fodder situation; - the timely introduction of a targeted Transport Subsidy Scheme to address the short­ age of supplies of fodder in the North and North West in January this year; - that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is in regular contact with all the stakeholders following the introduction of this scheme; - the timely introduction of a Fodder Import Support Scheme to cover all Co-oper­ atives and importers approved by the Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to import fodder; - the extension of the deadline for the submission of Nitrates derogation plans until 30th April, 2018; - the extension of grazing under the Traditional Hay Meadows (THM) measure in GLAS until 1st May, 2018; - the securing of a commitment towards flexibility in the ‘three crop rule’ under Greening requirements in Pillar 1 of the CAP; - the availability of rapid emergency feed assistance to any farmer facing immediate feed shortage through the Department’s Animal Welfare Helpline that supports the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council’s Early Warning Intervention System (EWS); - the need to ensure that farmers are adequately equipped with the necessary knowl­ edge and advice to deal with fluctuations in the weather and to keep fodder supplies under review; - the one-to-one assistance being provided to farmers by the Department of Agricul­ ture, Food and the Marine to lodge their Basic Payment Scheme applications; - the continuous monitoring of the situation by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Teagasc; - the increased regularity of severe weather events and the need to consider the inclu­ sion of appropriate risk management tools to mitigate against the impacts of such events on farming enterprises in the next iteration of the CAP.” I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad Chamber and I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue.  The sun is shining in Dublin today but I know from talking to farmers in Mayo and elsewhere that it is not necessarily shining there and in fact shines a lot less.  While the sun is shining, farmers are dealing with a grim situation.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, ap­ peared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine last week and going back to the Easter weekend, because the weather did not turn and we still had a cold biting wind, there was no growth.  The ground was wet and ground conditions were poor.  We would have hoped that things might have advanced naturally a lot better than they have but that is not the case.  Animals still are being housed.  Last weekend, some farmers attempted to let their cattle out for a few days, especially dairy farmers, but they are back in again.  In the meantime, since we last spoke, it has been necessary to provide another two weeks of fodder for these ani­ mals.  Animals still cannot be let out at present because they will dig up the ground and no crops will grow to provide fodder for next year.  Farmers are in an awful bind.  We talk about low-cost loans and about flexibility with banks and co-operatives but there are farmers who cannot get credit from their co-operatives any more.  Co-operatives are places with which dairy farmers in particular deal but this is not so much the case with suckler farmers.  They are not neces­ sarily getting credit and the banks are not necessarily showing flexibility.  We cannot assume they are and this is a predicament farmers face.  They continue to have to feed their animals.  I argue that in the north and north west, the fact that this problem was coming down the line was first highlighted when many farmers failed to cut a second crop of silage last autumn, as they normally would have done.  We knew immediately that there would be a problem, that farmers would not be able to provide for their animals in the normal way, that is, the most efficient and cheapest way that farmers can.  Since then, things have got worse around the country with the extended winter and bad weather.  I argue that the farmers in the west and north west are in the worst and most difficult position because some of them have already been buying fodder since January.  Many of them have been buying additional meal to stretch their fodder.  I must agree that the initial transport scheme that was suggested worked very well.  I welcome the flexibili­ ties that were introduced but farmers are dealing with a depressing situation.  My fear - not just for farmers - comes from considering the input that farming and the farming community have to local economies. Rural market towns throughout the country are dependent on farmers and their spending power.  If farmers are up to their necks in debt trying to pay for fodder, with another bill coming down the tracks for fertiliser as they will have to fertilise the land, there will be far less in their pockets for spending in the local economy.  I foresee a depression in rural market towns because if the farmers’ circumstances are on the up, the circumstances of these towns are on the up but, currently, that is not the case.  There is a case to be made, with strict criteria, for farmers who are in very difficult situations to be assisted.  If we do not find some type of formula, and we all accept that the weather is not going to improve suddenly and that we will have to deal with varied and inclement weather for longer periods, many people will leave farming.  Many of the farms where I live are marginal in any case, so why would one opt to farm when there are plenty of options in cities?  We are near to having full employment so why would one plan a career in farming if one is a suckler cow farmer?  These are very big challenges.  I cited this at the committee because it is quite sobering. The reality is that this is a weather problem.  I agree with the Minister, Deputy Creed, that if he had announced last November or December that he was going to start importing fodder, people would have laughed at him.  That does not mean one should not try to take measures. There was fodder in other parts of the country, and the issue was how to get it to the farmers who needed it.  I believe the crisis is as much a financial crisis for farmers, especially for those in the west and north west.  They have paid on a large scale and most of them have not been able to avail of the transport subsidy scheme because it was unworkable for them. We cannot blame the Minister for the weather.  In 2014, according to figures from the De­ partment, there were 6.3 million cattle in this country.  In 2018, before counting calves and the additional stock that are due to be counted by May, the national herd is 7.4 million cattle. In all our plans, our objective is to ramp up production on all sides, so this will be a recurring problem.  We must get a handle on how we are going to deal with this into the future.  There are issues with overstocking, which some farmers have been encouraged to do as there is no milk quota any more.  There must be a reality check about what is happening or we will have farmers on the breadline and people will not wish to get involved in farming.  If that happens we will not achieve the Food Wise 2025 targets. I welcome the news about the opening of the Chinese market which was announced by the Minister, Deputy Creed, during the week.  There is great potential there, but we must get this issue right.  I accept that the Minister is monitoring the situation on an ongoing basis but we will continue to be reminded of these realities, both in this House and in the agriculture committee, and of the fallout from what has happened with the weather.  If it does not improve, we will be talking about this issue a great deal more and very soon again.",

  "Exact Text": "'agriculture: statements' I welcome the Minister.  Without a doubt the most immedi­ ate and pressing issue in the north and north west of the country is fodder.  The continuously wet weather that people have been experiencing more or less since last summer, as previously outlined, has affected farmers’ ability to save silage, hay and so on.  It has also caused them to house animals at an early stage, putting more pressure on limited fodder.  I welcome the Min­ ister’s response, including the setting up of the fodder transport subsidy scheme.  This is very important.  Farmers who can see that they are or are about to be affected, or who face the im­ minent threat of running out of fodder, need to act. At the initial stages of the crisis, the Minister asked Teagasc to conduct a study of where fodder shortages might exist.  What was the nature of the report back to the Minister on the mat­ ter?  What numbers of farmers are involved?  What is the situation in individual counties?  Can the Minister paint a picture of the more empirical findings?  Farmers complain of the problem to me.  We know farming organisations have been highlighting the issue.  We would benefit from knowing what Teagasc has come up with. It has not stopped raining - that is the problem.  This is also leading to problems with hold­ ing tanks in slatted houses.  I am unsure what the Minister can do, but people cannot put animals on the land and the holding tanks are full to the brim.  It is beyond difficult and depressing for farmers at the moment.  They are on the land battling with all of this and there is no end in sight. If current conditions run for another while, it will only compound the issue.  I am keen to hear the views of the Minister in respect of the establishment of a meal voucher scheme.  At what point will the Minister consider that? The most critical issue, aside from the weather, is the upcoming meeting of Ministers on the EU Mercosur agreement.  We all know there is a serious threat to beef.  There is potential for significant tonnage of beef to be imported from South America on top of what has already been taken in.  Our beef and livestock sectors are significant to us.  Some 90% of output is exported and the sectors are worth €2.5 billion to the Irish economy.  An estimated 100,000 farmers are involved and 20,000 people are employed in marts, merchants, transport and input supplies. This could have far-reaching consequences, more immediate than Brexit. Farmers will be competing with countries we are better than in respect of traceability, food safety, animal health and environmental standards.  I presume the Minister will attend the meet­ ing.  How does the Minister see us positioned?  We have allies in the French.  This is serious. We have invested seriously in agriculture.  Everything needs to be done to protect the interests of the farmer.  If we do not protect the farmer, we will end up not meeting the targets in respect of Food Wise 2025 and so on.  There will be a further exodus of farmers from the land. Another issue that I raised previously will not go away any more than the bad weather will not go away.  This relates to climate change and the requirements on the agricultural sector. Farmers are getting a great deal of unbalanced or bad press.  Previously when the Minister was in the House, I cited the analysis done in the Citizens’ Assembly.  It was altogether unfair. I have heard from Department officials who are charged with this area of all the efforts and significant measures farmers have had to take and are taking.  More will be needed - no one is disputing that whatsoever.  However, farmers are already weighted down with all the efforts they must make, none of which are recognised at conventions such as the Citizens’ Assembly. This must be disappointing for farmers. I saw an interview from the European Parliament on Monday.  I was rather shocked at one of our MEPs, the Sinn Féin MEP, Ms Lynn Boylan.  She slammed farming practices in Ireland. Furthermore, she stated that our ambition to increase exports of dairy to Asia was unsustain­ able.  Apart from being unpatriotic in the face of us dealing with Mercosur negotiations, Brexit and the new Common Agricultural Policy, in respect of which we are already coming under pressure from significant green lobbies, it shows considerable ignorance of all the efforts farm­ ers are making.  Almost every scheme or agricultural practice is informed by environmental considerations.  Farmers play a considerable role in ensuring water quality, biodiversity and climate change.  Since 1990 there has been a 6% reduction in agricultural emissions notwith­ standing a 40% increase in output from farmers.  Ms Boylan did not seem to know, or it did not seem to bother her, that we are the most efficient in the world in carbon emissions in the dairy sector and the fifth most efficient when it comes to beef production in Europe.  There was sin­ gling out of farmers and a suggestion that dairy should be pulled back and that we should reduce the suckler herd and so on.  The reality where I live is that we have the co-operative Aurivo as well as several other co-operatives.  Larger co-operatives such as Kerry and Glanbia would shut down if we did not look for export markets.  Why not get dairy and beef from the most carbon- efficient producers, such as Ireland? We have carbon emissions and work remains to be done.  However, given that it is the big­ gest industry in the country, the comments represent poor form at a time when we need to see solidarity in Europe.  We need to see people fighting our corner.  Many people would like to pull the rug from under us, whether in respect of corporate tax or our farming.  Moreover, I am keen to note all the success stories that have made up the recovery of our economy. A body of work needs to be undertaken now.  This is something the Oireachtas Joint Com­ mittee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine encountered on a visit to Europe.  We found a lack of awareness or appreciation of the work that farmers and the Government are trying to do at every step.  Everyone is responsible for every step. If I were to be more critical about where we are going with carbon emissions, I would single out transport.  I am unsure why anyone would single out farming.  Transport is lagging behind like no other sector.  It is discouraging to encounter the singling out of farming.  This is something we have discussed before.  We are trying to bring people along.  That is how real change with an impact occurs.  We cannot say extreme and ridiculous things to people, such as that farmers should get rid of their animals.  There has been no recognition of all the efforts that have been taken.  As a result, people disengage.  We are going to lose the battle on climate change. This is a very nuanced situation.  As we face into the new CAP, further environmental re­ quirements will be made of Ireland.  I hope farmers will be properly compensated for that.  If more is being asked of farmers, farmers will need more compensation.  That has to be put into the mix. I am calling for a more balanced debate among politicians and in the media.  Where groups such as the Citizens’ Assembly engage in such debates, proper and full information should be available.  No one takes from the green lobby and what those involved have to offer.  We all have to wake up to that.  However, if we do not have a rounded debate, we will leave people behind us.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I welcome the Minister.  Without a doubt the most immedi­ ate and pressing issue in the north and north west of the country is fodder.  The continuously wet weather that people have been experiencing more or less since last summer, as previously outlined, has affected farmers’ ability to save silage, hay and so on.  It has also caused them to house animals at an early stage, putting more pressure on limited fodder.  I welcome the Min­ ister’s response, including the setting up of the fodder transport subsidy scheme.  This is very important.  Farmers who can see that they are or are about to be affected, or who face the im­ minent threat of running out of fodder, need to act. At the initial stages of the crisis, the Minister asked Teagasc to conduct a study of where fodder shortages might exist.  What was the nature of the report back to the Minister on the mat­ ter?  What numbers of farmers are involved?  What is the situation in individual counties?  Can the Minister paint a picture of the more empirical findings?  Farmers complain of the problem to me.  We know farming organisations have been highlighting the issue.  We would benefit from knowing what Teagasc has come up with. It has not stopped raining - that is the problem.  This is also leading to problems with hold­ ing tanks in slatted houses.  I am unsure what the Minister can do, but people cannot put animals on the land and the holding tanks are full to the brim.  It is beyond difficult and depressing for farmers at the moment.  They are on the land battling with all of this and there is no end in sight. If current conditions run for another while, it will only compound the issue.  I am keen to hear the views of the Minister in respect of the establishment of a meal voucher scheme.  At what point will the Minister consider that? The most critical issue, aside from the weather, is the upcoming meeting of Ministers on the EU Mercosur agreement.  We all know there is a serious threat to beef.  There is potential for significant tonnage of beef to be imported from South America on top of what has already been taken in.  Our beef and livestock sectors are significant to us.  Some 90% of output is exported and the sectors are worth €2.5 billion to the Irish economy.  An estimated 100,000 farmers are involved and 20,000 people are employed in marts, merchants, transport and input supplies. This could have far-reaching consequences, more immediate than Brexit. Farmers will be competing with countries we are better than in respect of traceability, food safety, animal health and environmental standards.  I presume the Minister will attend the meet­ ing.  How does the Minister see us positioned?  We have allies in the French.  This is serious. We have invested seriously in agriculture.  Everything needs to be done to protect the interests of the farmer.  If we do not protect the farmer, we will end up not meeting the targets in respect of Food Wise 2025 and so on.  There will be a further exodus of farmers from the land. Another issue that I raised previously will not go away any more than the bad weather will not go away.  This relates to climate change and the requirements on the agricultural sector. Farmers are getting a great deal of unbalanced or bad press.  Previously when the Minister was in the House, I cited the analysis done in the Citizens’ Assembly.  It was altogether unfair. I have heard from Department officials who are charged with this area of all the efforts and significant measures farmers have had to take and are taking.  More will be needed - no one is disputing that whatsoever.  However, farmers are already weighted down with all the efforts they must make, none of which are recognised at conventions such as the Citizens’ Assembly. This must be disappointing for farmers. I saw an interview from the European Parliament on Monday.  I was rather shocked at one of our MEPs, the Sinn Féin MEP, Ms Lynn Boylan.  She slammed farming practices in Ireland. Furthermore, she stated that our ambition to increase exports of dairy to Asia was unsustain­ able.  Apart from being unpatriotic in the face of us dealing with Mercosur negotiations, Brexit and the new Common Agricultural Policy, in respect of which we are already coming under pressure from significant green lobbies, it shows considerable ignorance of all the efforts farm­ ers are making.  Almost every scheme or agricultural practice is informed by environmental considerations.  Farmers play a considerable role in ensuring water quality, biodiversity and climate change.  Since 1990 there has been a 6% reduction in agricultural emissions notwith­ standing a 40% increase in output from farmers.  Ms Boylan did not seem to know, or it did not seem to bother her, that we are the most efficient in the world in carbon emissions in the dairy sector and the fifth most efficient when it comes to beef production in Europe.  There was sin­ gling out of farmers and a suggestion that dairy should be pulled back and that we should reduce the suckler herd and so on.  The reality where I live is that we have the co-operative Aurivo as well as several other co-operatives.  Larger co-operatives such as Kerry and Glanbia would shut down if we did not look for export markets.  Why not get dairy and beef from the most carbon- efficient producers, such as Ireland? We have carbon emissions and work remains to be done.  However, given that it is the big­ gest industry in the country, the comments represent poor form at a time when we need to see solidarity in Europe.  We need to see people fighting our corner.  Many people would like to pull the rug from under us, whether in respect of corporate tax or our farming.  Moreover, I am keen to note all the success stories that have made up the recovery of our economy. A body of work needs to be undertaken now.  This is something the Oireachtas Joint Com­ mittee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine encountered on a visit to Europe.  We found a lack of awareness or appreciation of the work that farmers and the Government are trying to do at every step.  Everyone is responsible for every step. If I were to be more critical about where we are going with carbon emissions, I would single out transport.  I am unsure why anyone would single out farming.  Transport is lagging behind like no other sector.  It is discouraging to encounter the singling out of farming.  This is something we have discussed before.  We are trying to bring people along.  That is how real change with an impact occurs.  We cannot say extreme and ridiculous things to people, such as that farmers should get rid of their animals.  There has been no recognition of all the efforts that have been taken.  As a result, people disengage.  We are going to lose the battle on climate change. This is a very nuanced situation.  As we face into the new CAP, further environmental re­ quirements will be made of Ireland.  I hope farmers will be properly compensated for that.  If more is being asked of farmers, farmers will need more compensation.  That has to be put into the mix. I am calling for a more balanced debate among politicians and in the media.  Where groups such as the Citizens’ Assembly engage in such debates, proper and full information should be available.  No one takes from the green lobby and what those involved have to offer.  We all have to wake up to that.  However, if we do not have a rounded debate, we will leave people behind us.",

  "Exact Text": "'beef sector: statements' I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  It can safely be said that as we face into Storm Lorenzo, our beef industry has faced a turbulent and stormy time throughout the summer.  Thankfully, we are at the other side of what has been a very acrimoni­ ous process that has exposed a serious lack of trust on the part of primary producers in meat pro­ cessors and the industry as a whole.  They believe they are not getting fair play for their product and that there is no recognition that they need to eke out an existence.  In a growing industry where a lot of profit is being made by meat processors and retailers, it is hard to believe that those at the beginning of the food supply chain have been in this situation for so long.  Clearly, things have come to a head. All of the players came to the beef talks and were part of the resolution, which is a work in progress.  The resolution was not the end point.  Work needs to be done to ensure that farm­ ing is put on a sustainable footing.  I acknowledge the role that the Minister played in bringing the parties together.  I imagine that, other than those closely involved with the process, people cannot appreciate the antipathy and differences between the parties, but the Minister managed to deal with the parties concerned.  It is to be hoped we are beginning to address the issue in a realistic fashion because, as the Minister said, there is no silver bullet. Notwithstanding the bad press, for once the issue of the beef prices got mainstream cover­ age.  There is much more awareness among consumers and the population at large that beef farmers have a hard time and are in a very difficult situation that needs to be addressed.  Every­ body appreciates and understands that now.  On a positive note, when we all look back to the time of the economic downturn, austerity and recession, we should remember that agriculture was a great source of pride, in particular beef and suckler farming, especially in areas where they are the dominant sector such as in the west and north west of Ireland. This is something we know how to do and knowledge has been passed on for generations. The current generations have the benefit of education, science and more understanding, but people instinctively know how to farm.  The more we invest in the sector and enable farmers to overcome the issues the better.  We are investing in jobs that are part of the social fabric of rural Ireland because that is where those jobs are located. I will touch on subjects mentioned by previous speakers.  Certain carbon efficiencies have been achieved since the 1990s.  We are now more carbon efficient in beef production than we were in the 1990s.  The size of the national herd has increased.  I do not think we are getting enough credit for that in all of the conversations about trade and from where beef is purchased. If we are importing beef, it should be subject to a rigorous carbon audit.  The only thing that is measurable in Brazil is the fact that it is cutting down the rainforest.  There is no way to measure inputs and outputs and how carbon efficient it is.  We have a sophisticated system and know what needs to be done. The Government’s climate action plan sets out a roadmap for a reduction in carbon emis­ sions in agriculture, but many other sectors do not have one.  We are still learning.  Let us give credit to farmers who have played ball and those who are prepared to do more, as well as the Department, Teagasc and other organisations.  Many good things are happening and there is a positive story among all of the difficulties.  The truth is that we cannot get away from price, which feeds into sustainability and whether suckler farming continues in the manner in which we are used to.  If we do not address this issue, the face of rural Ireland will change. The Minister’s Department produced the annual review and outlook for agriculture 2019. It is interesting to read about the increase in exports to €2.4 billion, which is a 1% increase in value.  Slaughter volumes increased by 3.6% between 2017 and 2018.  Live exports increased by 30%.  These figures show that a lot of work is being done by the Minister, his officials and Bord Bia.  The irony is that tracking prices during the same period show they have gone down and have flatlined.  There will be a serious issue if we continue to ramp up production.  The size of the national herd has reduced, but we cannot continue with this model simply because it is something we are good at.  We export 90% of the beef we produce.  How can we continue this model?  We cannot, which is why the work of the beef market task force is absolutely critical. It has to be grounded in reality.  I acknowledge that the Minister has given his seal of approval to producer organisations, but the problem is that farmers do not have bargaining power.  They need to be able to come together as a collective.  European legislation has been amended to allow agreements between the different players in the food supply chain, namely, the retailers, the meat processors, etc.  Farmers need to have clout because they do not have it and just take a price.  They need to be encouraged and given the proper support to do it.  They need investment to establish something similar to the co-ops which provide benefits for dairy farmers.  We need them for beef farmers too and to drive forward with the plan. Market transparency is critical as we are talking about fair competition and fair prices for farmers.  There is no transparency in the market.  That should tell us what the farmer gets and what a person pays for meat in a supermarket such that we can guesstimate the difference. Farmers believe all of the money is made in the middle, not by them.  Some of this is unfair and the suggestion is that it is anti-competitive, even though the Competition and Consumer Protec­ tion Commission states it has no evidence that it is.  The more transparency we have, the more a light can be shone on the issues surrounding cartels, concerted practices and competition. I would like to see implementation of the unfair trading practices directive.  A lot of work was done on it by the European Commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan.  This is the time for us to see benefits on the ground.  The introduction of a regulator will be critical in that regard. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine met the groceries regulator in the United Kingdom, which has been working to very good effect.  It is unfortunate that the mul­ tiple retailers are not on board at the task force.  If the heads of a Bill to legislate to implement the directive are published, the retailers will have to come to the table because the legislation will impact on them.  They ignored the joint committee when we produced a report on the beef industry and Food Wise 2025, but they cannot ignore this issue.  It is not acceptable to ignore us because they gain many benefits from operating within a democracy and the protections we give them.  It speaks poorly of them that they do not see it as worth their while to engage with us.  I ask the Minister for an update on this issue.  I know that it comes under the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, but the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will work hand in hand with her on it.  It is critical that the regulator have teeth and not come under the umbrella of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commis­ sion, which has told us that it is only concerned about consumers.  We want to have a regulator that will protect small and medium enterprises and farmers. Senator Paul Daly asked about the €22 million that has not been claimed under the beef exceptional aid measure.  I called for an extension of the reference period, from May through to July, because animals were slaughtered at that time and people were losing money.  With Brexit coming, farmers will need more help, whichever way it goes, and we do not want to send back money.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  It can safely be said that as we face into Storm Lorenzo, our beef industry has faced a turbulent and stormy time throughout the summer.  Thankfully, we are at the other side of what has been a very acrimoni­ ous process that has exposed a serious lack of trust on the part of primary producers in meat pro­ cessors and the industry as a whole.  They believe they are not getting fair play for their product and that there is no recognition that they need to eke out an existence.  In a growing industry where a lot of profit is being made by meat processors and retailers, it is hard to believe that those at the beginning of the food supply chain have been in this situation for so long.  Clearly, things have come to a head. All of the players came to the beef talks and were part of the resolution, which is a work in progress.  The resolution was not the end point.  Work needs to be done to ensure that farm­ ing is put on a sustainable footing.  I acknowledge the role that the Minister played in bringing the parties together.  I imagine that, other than those closely involved with the process, people cannot appreciate the antipathy and differences between the parties, but the Minister managed to deal with the parties concerned.  It is to be hoped we are beginning to address the issue in a realistic fashion because, as the Minister said, there is no silver bullet. Notwithstanding the bad press, for once the issue of the beef prices got mainstream cover­ age.  There is much more awareness among consumers and the population at large that beef farmers have a hard time and are in a very difficult situation that needs to be addressed.  Every­ body appreciates and understands that now.  On a positive note, when we all look back to the time of the economic downturn, austerity and recession, we should remember that agriculture was a great source of pride, in particular beef and suckler farming, especially in areas where they are the dominant sector such as in the west and north west of Ireland. This is something we know how to do and knowledge has been passed on for generations. The current generations have the benefit of education, science and more understanding, but people instinctively know how to farm.  The more we invest in the sector and enable farmers to overcome the issues the better.  We are investing in jobs that are part of the social fabric of rural Ireland because that is where those jobs are located. I will touch on subjects mentioned by previous speakers.  Certain carbon efficiencies have been achieved since the 1990s.  We are now more carbon efficient in beef production than we were in the 1990s.  The size of the national herd has increased.  I do not think we are getting enough credit for that in all of the conversations about trade and from where beef is purchased. If we are importing beef, it should be subject to a rigorous carbon audit.  The only thing that is measurable in Brazil is the fact that it is cutting down the rainforest.  There is no way to measure inputs and outputs and how carbon efficient it is.  We have a sophisticated system and know what needs to be done. The Government’s climate action plan sets out a roadmap for a reduction in carbon emis­ sions in agriculture, but many other sectors do not have one.  We are still learning.  Let us give credit to farmers who have played ball and those who are prepared to do more, as well as the Department, Teagasc and other organisations.  Many good things are happening and there is a positive story among all of the difficulties.  The truth is that we cannot get away from price, which feeds into sustainability and whether suckler farming continues in the manner in which we are used to.  If we do not address this issue, the face of rural Ireland will change. The Minister’s Department produced the annual review and outlook for agriculture 2019. It is interesting to read about the increase in exports to €2.4 billion, which is a 1% increase in value.  Slaughter volumes increased by 3.6% between 2017 and 2018.  Live exports increased by 30%.  These figures show that a lot of work is being done by the Minister, his officials and Bord Bia.  The irony is that tracking prices during the same period show they have gone down and have flatlined.  There will be a serious issue if we continue to ramp up production.  The size of the national herd has reduced, but we cannot continue with this model simply because it is something we are good at.  We export 90% of the beef we produce.  How can we continue this model?  We cannot, which is why the work of the beef market task force is absolutely critical. It has to be grounded in reality.  I acknowledge that the Minister has given his seal of approval to producer organisations, but the problem is that farmers do not have bargaining power.  They need to be able to come together as a collective.  European legislation has been amended to allow agreements between the different players in the food supply chain, namely, the retailers, the meat processors, etc.  Farmers need to have clout because they do not have it and just take a price.  They need to be encouraged and given the proper support to do it.  They need investment to establish something similar to the co-ops which provide benefits for dairy farmers.  We need them for beef farmers too and to drive forward with the plan. Market transparency is critical as we are talking about fair competition and fair prices for farmers.  There is no transparency in the market.  That should tell us what the farmer gets and what a person pays for meat in a supermarket such that we can guesstimate the difference. Farmers believe all of the money is made in the middle, not by them.  Some of this is unfair and the suggestion is that it is anti-competitive, even though the Competition and Consumer Protec­ tion Commission states it has no evidence that it is.  The more transparency we have, the more a light can be shone on the issues surrounding cartels, concerted practices and competition. I would like to see implementation of the unfair trading practices directive.  A lot of work was done on it by the European Commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan.  This is the time for us to see benefits on the ground.  The introduction of a regulator will be critical in that regard. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine met the groceries regulator in the United Kingdom, which has been working to very good effect.  It is unfortunate that the mul­ tiple retailers are not on board at the task force.  If the heads of a Bill to legislate to implement the directive are published, the retailers will have to come to the table because the legislation will impact on them.  They ignored the joint committee when we produced a report on the beef industry and Food Wise 2025, but they cannot ignore this issue.  It is not acceptable to ignore us because they gain many benefits from operating within a democracy and the protections we give them.  It speaks poorly of them that they do not see it as worth their while to engage with us.  I ask the Minister for an update on this issue.  I know that it comes under the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, but the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will work hand in hand with her on it.  It is critical that the regulator have teeth and not come under the umbrella of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commis­ sion, which has told us that it is only concerned about consumers.  We want to have a regulator that will protect small and medium enterprises and farmers. Senator Paul Daly asked about the €22 million that has not been claimed under the beef exceptional aid measure.  I called for an extension of the reference period, from May through to July, because animals were slaughtered at that time and people were losing money.  With Brexit coming, farmers will need more help, whichever way it goes, and we do not want to send back money.",

  "Exact Text": "'progress in relation to climate change: statements' I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comprehensive state­ ment.  As Members are all aware, the agrifood sector supports 300,000 jobs in rural communi­ ties where they are most needed, and it is our largest indigenous industry, with food and drink exports reaching €12 billion in 2018.  When we discuss progress on climate action, we have to be cognisant of these facts and always consider the sustainability of the industry in whatever measures are taken and need to be taken.  Irish and EU food security concerns must be put on an equal footing with climate change responsibilities and the central role of an exporting country such as Ireland, which has a carbon-efficient food production sector.  By 2050, agriculture will need to produce almost 50% more food than it did in 2012, according to the UN, to meet global food demand.  Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions profile is unique within Europe, being heav­ ily weighted towards agriculture due to the lack of heavy industry within our overall economy. The inclusion of land use, land use change and forestry within the scope of the new EU 2030 climate change framework is a welcome development and represents a sensible approach, broadening the tools available to Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration.  This will enable Ireland access the removal of 26.8 million tonnes of carbon di­ oxide emissions over the 2021 to 2030 period.  While this inclusion is welcome, it can go much further.  We need to get down to the nitty-gritty, if possible, of eventually reaching the point of being able to have individual farm carbon footprint indicators.  This may not be scientifically possible and may be an onerous task.  There are 440,000 km of hedgerow which are maintained and form part of farm holdings but for which there are no carbon credits.  As the Minister said, the farmers are the custodians of rural Ireland and of the environment.  If we were to take into consideration all the good work they do, for example, on those hedgerows, scrubs, poor areas of land, wetlands and small areas of forestation, along with our official forests, for want of a better term, there is a possibility and at least the potential to reach carbon neutrality on many farms if we get credit as farmers for the good work we do, heretofore unrecognised. For 2017, total Irish greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors are estimated to be 0.9% lower than emissions in 2016.  Agriculture, however, remains the largest contributor to overall emissions, at 33% of the total, with the transport and energy industries the next largest contribu­ tors, each at 20%.  Agriculture emissions increased by just under 3% in 2017, which reflects the expansion of the dairy herd post-quotas and the national policy to expand the sector under Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.  While dairy cow numbers increased by 3% in the year to 2017, this was in the context of milk production increasing by 9% over the 12 month period. This is another indicator of the work being done.  To coin an old phrase, there is a lot done but a hell of a lot more needs to be done. Nitrogen fertiliser is the major issue.  Its use increased by 8.8% in 2017.  Soil fertility and the use of fertilisers such as nitrogen need to be looked at seriously and incorporated in any future schemes, be it the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, or whatever else, with a view to improving our greenhouse gas emissions. Sometimes we can learn more about the future by looking at the past.  It is a proven fact that between 1990 and 2017, agricultural emissions in Ireland decreased by 0.7% while production increased by 40%.  I know that the figures and the extent of the increase in numbers have prob­ ably changed since that period, but this just goes to show that because of the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and similar schemes, we were able to increase production while reducing emissions.  We could learn lessons from the past, and it is no harm at times to look back to schemes that have worked when we devise schemes for the future.  During the period when agricultural emissions decreased by 7%, transport sector emissions increased by 133% and energy sector emissions increased by 118%. It is not that Irish agriculture’s output is high-polluting.  In fact, Ireland is one of the most highly intensive, lowest-carbon food producers in the world.  The carbon footprint per kilogram of output of Irish farms is one of the lowest globally.  According to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Irish dairying is the most efficient carbon dioxide per kilogram of milk in the EU, while Irish beef production is the fifth most efficient CO2 per kilogram of beef. It is essential that EU emissions targets are balanced with sustainable food output.  Otherwise, there is the risk that they could become self-defeating, leading to a transfer of food produc­ tion, also known as carbon leakage, to other countries which have lower overall costs but less carbon-efficient production methods.  This argument has been made by the agriculture sector and the political sector at times but is not being accepted in many circles.  However, it is factual. The climate action that is needed is needed globally.  While we might solve all our problems in Ireland by reducing production and ticking all the boxes, we are only one small island in the global picture, the beef we are so efficiently producing would then be replaced by production in places such as Brazil with a carbon footprint four times ours, and it still would not change the rate of global climate change. Many CAP and rural development schemes have requirements which incentivise and re­ quire environmentally beneficial farming practices and the reduction of our carbon footprint. These include greening measures; the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which has 50,000 farmers participating; and the beef data and genomics programme, which is genotyping up to 1 million cattle to improve the carbon footprint in the suckler herd.  Ireland’s Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 is providing support for climate change adaptation and mitigation actions, with 85% of total measures in this area.  Much more action is needed, however, together with the adoption of new technologies to reduce the carbon footprint further, and the provision of further incentives to meet targets in the next CAP to accelerate the delivery of greenhouse gas reduction in farming practices. Irrespective of the headline of the topic of debate we will have when it comes to agriculture, it will eventually always come back to the sustainability of farming as a whole, the commodity prices and the farmer’s income.  As the Minister quite rightly said, farmers are the custodians of the environment.  They are very conscious of the role they play and can play and the improve­ ments they can make in this area.  It is very hard, however, to get anyone to do anything when he or she does not have the hard cash to do it.  When farmers are struggling because of their margins to put food on their family tables and to educate their children, the improvements they need to make to their efficiency will be way down their list of priorities, because by the time they get to those improvements, they will not have any money left.  Therefore, while it would not be a fix-all solution, it would certainly set the train of thought, the attitude and the ambition of the farming community in the right direction if we could get them a fair price for their com­ modity and if they had some disposable income at the end of the day to invest in the technolo­ gies, the processes and the methods they need to adopt to improve the situation.

  "Exact Text For Combined": "I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comprehensive state­ ment.  As Members are all aware, the agrifood sector supports 300,000 jobs in rural communi­ ties where they are most needed, and it is our largest indigenous industry, with food and drink exports reaching €12 billion in 2018.  When we discuss progress on climate action, we have to be cognisant of these facts and always consider the sustainability of the industry in whatever measures are taken and need to be taken.  Irish and EU food security concerns must be put on an equal footing with climate change responsibilities and the central role of an exporting country such as Ireland, which has a carbon-efficient food production sector.  By 2050, agriculture will need to produce almost 50% more food than it did in 2012, according to the UN, to meet global food demand.  Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions profile is unique within Europe, being heav­ ily weighted towards agriculture due to the lack of heavy industry within our overall economy. The inclusion of land use, land use change and forestry within the scope of the new EU 2030 climate change framework is a welcome development and represents a sensible approach, broadening the tools available to Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through carbon sequestration.  This will enable Ireland access the removal of 26.8 million tonnes of carbon di­ oxide emissions over the 2021 to 2030 period.  While this inclusion is welcome, it can go much further.  We need to get down to the nitty-gritty, if possible, of eventually reaching the point of being able to have individual farm carbon footprint indicators.  This may not be scientifically possible and may be an onerous task.  There are 440,000 km of hedgerow which are maintained and form part of farm holdings but for which there are no carbon credits.  As the Minister said, the farmers are the custodians of rural Ireland and of the environment.  If we were to take into consideration all the good work they do, for example, on those hedgerows, scrubs, poor areas of land, wetlands and small areas of forestation, along with our official forests, for want of a better term, there is a possibility and at least the potential to reach carbon neutrality on many farms if we get credit as farmers for the good work we do, heretofore unrecognised. For 2017, total Irish greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors are estimated to be 0.9% lower than emissions in 2016.  Agriculture, however, remains the largest contributor to overall emissions, at 33% of the total, with the transport and energy industries the next largest contribu­ tors, each at 20%.  Agriculture emissions increased by just under 3% in 2017, which reflects the expansion of the dairy herd post-quotas and the national policy to expand the sector under Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.  While dairy cow numbers increased by 3% in the year to 2017, this was in the context of milk production increasing by 9% over the 12 month period. This is another indicator of the work being done.  To coin an old phrase, there is a lot done but a hell of a lot more needs to be done. Nitrogen fertiliser is the major issue.  Its use increased by 8.8% in 2017.  Soil fertility and the use of fertilisers such as nitrogen need to be looked at seriously and incorporated in any future schemes, be it the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, or whatever else, with a view to improving our greenhouse gas emissions. Sometimes we can learn more about the future by looking at the past.  It is a proven fact that between 1990 and 2017, agricultural emissions in Ireland decreased by 0.7% while production increased by 40%.  I know that the figures and the extent of the increase in numbers have prob­ ably changed since that period, but this just goes to show that because of the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, and similar schemes, we were able to increase production while reducing emissions.  We could learn lessons from the past, and it is no harm at times to look back to schemes that have worked when we devise schemes for the future.  During the period when agricultural emissions decreased by 7%, transport sector emissions increased by 133% and energy sector emissions increased by 118%. It is not that Irish agriculture’s output is high-polluting.  In fact, Ireland is one of the most highly intensive, lowest-carbon food producers in the world.  The carbon footprint per kilogram of output of Irish farms is one of the lowest globally.  According to the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, Irish dairying is the most efficient carbon dioxide per kilogram of milk in the EU, while Irish beef production is the fifth most efficient CO2 per kilogram of beef. It is essential that EU emissions targets are balanced with sustainable food output.  Otherwise, there is the risk that they could become self-defeating, leading to a transfer of food produc­ tion, also known as carbon leakage, to other countries which have lower overall costs but less carbon-efficient production methods.  This argument has been made by the agriculture sector and the political sector at times but is not being accepted in many circles.  However, it is factual. The climate action that is needed is needed globally.  While we might solve all our problems in Ireland by reducing production and ticking all the boxes, we are only one small island in the global picture, the beef we are so efficiently producing would then be replaced by production in places such as Brazil with a carbon footprint four times ours, and it still would not change the rate of global climate change. Many CAP and rural development schemes have requirements which incentivise and re­ quire environmentally beneficial farming practices and the reduction of our carbon footprint. These include greening measures; the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which has 50,000 farmers participating; and the beef data and genomics programme, which is genotyping up to 1 million cattle to improve the carbon footprint in the suckler herd.  Ireland’s Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 is providing support for climate change adaptation and mitigation actions, with 85% of total measures in this area.  Much more action is needed, however, together with the adoption of new technologies to reduce the carbon footprint further, and the provision of further incentives to meet targets in the next CAP to accelerate the delivery of greenhouse gas reduction in farming practices. Irrespective of the headline of the topic of debate we will have when it comes to agriculture, it will eventually always come back to the sustainability of farming as a whole, the commodity prices and the farmer’s income.  As the Minister quite rightly said, farmers are the custodians of the environment.  They are very conscious of the role they play and can play and the improve­ ments they can make in this area.  It is very hard, however, to get anyone to do anything when he or she does not have the hard cash to do it.  When farmers are struggling because of their margins to put food on their family tables and to educate their children, the improvements they need to make to their efficiency will be way down their list of priorities, because by the time they get to those improvements, they will not have any money left.  Therefore, while it would not be a fix-all solution, it would certainly set the train of thought, the attitude and the ambition of the farming community in the right direction if we could get them a fair price for their com­ modity and if they had some disposable income at the end of the day to invest in the technolo­ gies, the processes and the methods they need to adopt to improve the situation.

  "Exact Text": "'environmental policy' I thank the Minister of State for being here today.  As Senator Boyhan said, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue contacted me to say that he could not be here because he is launching an important climate action strategy.  It is important that a member of the Green Party is taking this Commencement matter.  I ask that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine update the House on the actions of the Department to audit and calculate the current carbon sequestration of agricultural land and farm holdings. The Minister of State knows this issue is important.  I have been talking about it for years and I am very frustrated by the lack of clarity.  We have had crazy debates, some of which in­ volved bullying, over the summer with regard to carbon budgets for agriculture.  The narrative by some media and elected representatives around the conversation shows a level of misunder­ standing by the majority of Irish agriculture and, as a result, often threatens and downgrades Irish agriculture.  Such a narrative can be very difficult for farming families. The agri sector people speak about is not an anonymous entity.  Rather, it comprises the farm I grew up on which my family farms to this day and my neighbours.  Many people struggle to make ends meet.  While trying to keep farms going they are hearing that we need to cut emis­ sions.  They agree with that, but they feel taken advantage of because farm holdings big and small are the carbon sink of the nation and there is no acknowledgement by the State of this. Trees, grass, soil and even sheep’s wool sequester carbon.  Some 400,000 km of hedgerows across this country are carbon sinks and biodiversity havens. The lowly, common hawthorn can support more than 200 insect species.  That alone is something that should be acknowledged. We are entering an era that could be an exciting time for farmers.  We could be empower­ ing our farmers and we could be giving them control in working towards net-zero agriculture. We could also be allowing them to send energy from solar panels back onto the grid.  There are acres of roof space across the country, but for some bureaucratic lack of will they are denied the ability to do this.  I passionately believe the science will back me up when I say that many of our farmers are actually farming at net zero. As the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is probably well aware, a private enterprise, an agri-tech company named Devenish, has launched the ground-breaking sustainable farming ini­ tiative which helps to decarbonise the global agricultural sector by supporting farmers to con­ tinue to produce nutritious meat and milk while dramatically improving their carbon balance. Knowing one’s carbon balance sheet will help one identify the actions that will help the wider agricultural sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions and beyond, boosting environmental cre­ dentials for producers and processors at every point along the food the chain.  Accurately mea­ suring on-farm carbon emissions and carbon sequestration will create a new value for farmers across the island of Ireland and will substantially accelerate the achievement of climate goals while improving biodiversity, water quality and overall farm resilience. The Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland is do­ ing this on a voluntary basis on dairy farms.  There are already many farms across the country that are undertaking this work through various initiatives, but they are doing mitigation in the dark.  Knowledge is power, and it is vital that we empower this industry to understand the base­ lines and to drive improvements in its efforts to mitigate climate change.",

  "Exact Text": "'greenhouse gas emissions' The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is very welcome to the Seanad this morning.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, cannot be with us because he is at a press conference.  Given Waterford’s very fertile agricultural land, I know the Minister of State will have an interest in this matter. I seek a statement from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the au­ dit and calculation of the current carbon sequestration of agricultural land and farm holdings, which is basically a carbon balance sheet for farm enterprises. This is a very important issue, one I have been talking about for many years.  I am very frus­ trated by the lack of clarity on the topic.  We have had crazy debates, including some bullying in my opinion, over carbon budgets for agriculture.  The narrative from some in the media and among elected representatives in this debate shows a significant level of misunderstanding by the majority about Irish agriculture.  As a result, it often threatens and downgrades agriculture. That can be very difficult. The agricultural sector people speak about is not some sort of anonymous entity.  It is the farm I grew up on.  It is the farm my neighbours toil on and where they struggle to make ends meet every single day of the week.  While we are trying to keep all that going, we must cut emissions, which we agree with, but why are farmers taken advantage of? We have big and small farm holdings.  They are the carbon sink of this nation and to date there is no acknowledgement of that by the State.  Trees, grass, soil and even sheep’s wool se­ questers carbon.  The 400,000 km of hedgerows right across the country is a carbon sink and a biodiversity haven.  Even the lowly common hawthorn has about 200 different insects living on it.  We are entering into an era that could be a very exciting time for farmers.  We could be em­ powering farmers and giving them control to work towards the net-zero agriculture we all want and they want.  I passionately believe that science will back me up on this and that the majority of farmers, in particular the small ones, are farming in a net-zero way in terms of carbon, and that we can do this. Devenish, a private agri-technology company, has done this in County Meath. It is using sustainable farming initiatives that help decarbonise global agriculture by supporting farmers to continue to produce nutritious meat and milk while dramatically improving their carbon bal­ ance.  As the Minister of State is aware, knowing the carbon balance sheet leads to the identifi­ cation of actions that will help the wider agricultural sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions and beyond.  That will boost environmental credentials for producers and processors at every point along the food chain. I was very glad to hear the announcement this morning by the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, about an extra €2 million in funding for his research budget, bringing it to €22.45 million.  To quote the press release, “This will be used to drive greater innovation in our agri­ culture, food, forestry and bioeconomy sectors as we position Irish agriculture as a leader in sustainable food production.  In addition, Teagasc will receive an allocation of €168 million to support their activities.” I know the Department is behind me on this, but I want to ensure that money will be put into farms to make sure every farm is audited.  We could start a pilot project in County Louth because we have every type of agriculture there - tillage, grain, sheep, cattle, dairy and we even have aquaculture - to ensure that every single farm has a carbon balance sheet.  I am very ex­ cited about this.  I hope the new research budget will assist in that regard.",

  "Exact Text For Combined": "The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is very welcome to the Seanad this morning.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, cannot be with us because he is at a press conference.  Given Waterford’s very fertile agricultural land, I know the Minister of State will have an interest in this matter. I seek a statement from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the au­ dit and calculation of the current carbon sequestration of agricultural land and farm holdings, which is basically a carbon balance sheet for farm enterprises. This is a very important issue, one I have been talking about for many years.  I am very frus­ trated by the lack of clarity on the topic.  We have had crazy debates, including some bullying in my opinion, over carbon budgets for agriculture.  The narrative from some in the media and among elected representatives in this debate shows a significant level of misunderstanding by the majority about Irish agriculture.  As a result, it often threatens and downgrades agriculture. That can be very difficult. The agricultural sector people speak about is not some sort of anonymous entity.  It is the farm I grew up on.  It is the farm my neighbours toil on and where they struggle to make ends meet every single day of the week.  While we are trying to keep all that going, we must cut emissions, which we agree with, but why are farmers taken advantage of? We have big and small farm holdings.  They are the carbon sink of this nation and to date there is no acknowledgement of that by the State.  Trees, grass, soil and even sheep’s wool se­ questers carbon.  The 400,000 km of hedgerows right across the country is a carbon sink and a biodiversity haven.  Even the lowly common hawthorn has about 200 different insects living on it.  We are entering into an era that could be a very exciting time for farmers.  We could be em­ powering farmers and giving them control to work towards the net-zero agriculture we all want and they want.  I passionately believe that science will back me up on this and that the majority of farmers, in particular the small ones, are farming in a net-zero way in terms of carbon, and that we can do this. Devenish, a private agri-technology company, has done this in County Meath. It is using sustainable farming initiatives that help decarbonise global agriculture by supporting farmers to continue to produce nutritious meat and milk while dramatically improving their carbon bal­ ance.  As the Minister of State is aware, knowing the carbon balance sheet leads to the identifi­ cation of actions that will help the wider agricultural sector to reach net-zero carbon emissions and beyond.  That will boost environmental credentials for producers and processors at every point along the food chain. I was very glad to hear the announcement this morning by the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, about an extra €2 million in funding for his research budget, bringing it to €22.45 million.  To quote the press release, “This will be used to drive greater innovation in our agri­ culture, food, forestry and bioeconomy sectors as we position Irish agriculture as a leader in sustainable food production.  In addition, Teagasc will receive an allocation of €168 million to support their activities.” I know the Department is behind me on this, but I want to ensure that money will be put into farms to make sure every farm is audited.  We could start a pilot project in County Louth because we have every type of agriculture there - tillage, grain, sheep, cattle, dairy and we even have aquaculture - to ensure that every single farm has a carbon balance sheet.  I am very ex­ cited about this.  I hope the new research budget will assist in that regard.",

I know it can be done because Devenish has done it.  It has done incredible research in Dowth in County Meath just across the border from County Louth.  By accurately measuring on-farm carbon emissions, we can capture and understand carbon sequestration and the power of our land. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs is doing this.  It is putting money behind this on a voluntary basis for dairy farmers.  The Department acknowledges that many farms across the country are doing incredible work in various miti­ gation initiatives.  Regarding carbon balance, if people do not know their balance sheet, they are working in the dark so an understanding of the figures is needed.  Farmers then need to be rewarded when they are doing a really good job.",
